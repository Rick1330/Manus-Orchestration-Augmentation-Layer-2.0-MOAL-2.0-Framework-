# Appendix A: Consolidated Templates

## Introduction to Templates

This appendix consolidates all the practical templates introduced throughout the Comprehensive Human Collaborator's Guide to MOAL 2.0. These templates provide structured frameworks for developing and maintaining the external structures that support MOAL 2.0, as well as for managing various aspects of your collaboration.

Each template is designed to be practical and adaptable. While they provide a solid starting point, you should customize them to fit your specific context and needs. The templates are organized by category for easy reference.

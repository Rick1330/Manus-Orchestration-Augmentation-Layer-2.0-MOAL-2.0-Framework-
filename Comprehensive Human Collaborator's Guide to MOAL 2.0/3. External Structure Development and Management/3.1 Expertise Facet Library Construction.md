## 7. Best Practices for Facet Granularity

Finding the right level of granularity for your facets is crucial for building an effective library.

### Too Broad vs. Too Narrow

**Signs of Overly Broad Facets:**
- Covers multiple distinct methodologies or approaches
- Contains numerous potentially conflicting principles
- Difficult to apply consistently across different contexts
- Requires significant internal qualification when used
- Contains too many distinct sub-areas to be cohesive

**Signs of Overly Narrow Facets:**
- Rarely applicable outside very specific situations
- Significant overlap with other facets
- Difficult to distinguish from similar facets
- Requires frequent combination with other facets to be useful
- Focuses on techniques rather than fundamental approaches

### Granularity Guidelines by Facet Type

**Knowledge Domain Facets:**
- Should represent recognized fields of expertise
- Typically align with professional disciplines or established subject areas
- Should be broad enough to encompass multiple related concepts and methodologies
- Should be narrow enough to have distinctive principles and approaches

**Reasoning Style Facets:**
- Should represent fundamentally different approaches to problem-solving
- Each style should have distinctive process steps and characteristics
- Should be applicable across multiple knowledge domains
- Should represent a coherent mental model or cognitive approach

**Perspective Facets:**
- Should represent distinct viewpoints with unique priorities and concerns
- Should be differentiated by fundamental values and focus areas
- Should offer meaningfully different insights when applied to the same situation
- Should align with recognizable stakeholder groups or analytical lenses

**Communication Style Facets:**
- Should represent distinctive approaches to information presentation
- Should be appropriate for different audience types or communication contexts
- Should have clearly identifiable language patterns and organizational structures
- Should serve different communication purposes or goals

### Practical Granularity Test Questions

When evaluating whether a facet has appropriate granularity, ask:

1. **Distinctiveness:** "Does this facet have a clearly distinct focus from others in the library?"
2. **Cohesiveness:** "Do all elements within this facet naturally belong together?"
3. **Applicability:** "Is this facet broadly applicable enough to be worth maintaining?"
4. **Specificity:** "Is this facet specific enough to provide meaningful guidance?"
5. **Stability:** "Does this facet represent a relatively stable body of knowledge or approach?"
6. **Utility:** "Will this facet be regularly useful in our collaborative work?"

If you answer "no" to any of these questions, consider adjusting the facet's scope.

## 8. Evolving Your Expertise Facet Library

### Regular Review and Update Cycles

Establish a systematic approach to library evolution:

**Quarterly Review Process:**
1. Review usage patterns to identify most and least used facets
2. Assess whether any facets need updates based on new developments
3. Identify potential gaps in the library based on recent collaboration needs
4. Update at least 2-3 high-priority facets with new information
5. Document changes in the library changelog

**Annual Comprehensive Review:**
1. Conduct a complete library audit reviewing all facets
2. Identify redundancies, gaps, and opportunities for consolidation
3. Update all facets that have significant new developments
4. Reconsider the overall library structure and organization
5. Establish evolution priorities for the coming year

### Signals for Creating New Facets

Watch for these indicators that a new facet may be needed:

1. **Recurring Expertise Need:** You frequently need to describe the same type of expertise
2. **Emerging Field:** A new domain or approach becomes increasingly relevant
3. **Excessive Complexity:** An existing facet has grown too complex and should be split
4. **Hybrid Usage Pattern:** You consistently combine the same facets, suggesting a new integrated facet
5. **Adaptation Challenges:** An existing facet requires significant adaptation each time it's used

### Signals for Retiring or Merging Facets

Consider retiring or merging facets when you observe:

1. **Disuse:** A facet hasn't been referenced in 6+ months of active collaboration
2. **Redundancy:** Two or more facets have significant overlap in content and application
3. **Obsolescence:** The expertise area has been superseded or is no longer relevant
4. **Consistent Co-activation:** Two facets are almost always used together, suggesting they should be merged
5. **Fragmentation:** Several narrow facets could be more effectively combined into a cohesive whole

### Leveraging MOAL 2.0 Feedback for Library Evolution

Use feedback from our interactions to guide library evolution:

**Expertise Evolution Tracker Outputs:**
When I provide feedback like "The Market Research Knowledge facet was helpful but could be enhanced with more focus on digital research methodologies," document these suggestions for your next update cycle.

**Knowledge Gap Identifier Outputs:**
When I indicate "This question involves aspects of behavioral economics that aren't fully captured in our current facets," consider this a signal to potentially create a new facet.

**Usage Pattern Analysis:**
Pay attention to which facets you activate most frequently and which combinations prove most effective, using these patterns to guide library development.

### Version Control for Facets

Implement a simple version control approach:

1. **Version Numbering:** Use semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0, v1.1, v2.0)
   - Increment first number for major revisions (v1.0 → v2.0)
   - Increment decimal for minor updates (v1.0 → v1.1)

2. **Change Documentation:** Within each facet, maintain the Version History section:
   ```markdown
   ## Version History
   - Created: May 16, 2025, v1.0
   - Updated: July 10, 2025, v1.1 - Added digital research methodologies
   - Updated: January 15, 2026, v2.0 - Major restructuring with expanded sections on...
   ```

3. **Archiving:** Rather than deleting outdated facets, move them to an archive folder:
   ```
   /expertise_facet_library/
     /archive/
       /knowledge_domains/
         Market_Research_Knowledge_v1.0.md
   ```

## 9. Troubleshooting Common Facet Library Issues

### Issue: Overlapping Facets

**Symptoms:**
- Confusion about which facet to activate for specific needs

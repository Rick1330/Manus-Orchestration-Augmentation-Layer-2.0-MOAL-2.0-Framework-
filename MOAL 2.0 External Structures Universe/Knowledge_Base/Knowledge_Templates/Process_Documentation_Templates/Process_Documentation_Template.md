# Process Documentation Template

## Overview
This template provides a standardized format for documenting processes within the MOAL 2.0 Knowledge Base. It is designed to capture procedural knowledge in a structured, actionable manner that facilitates understanding, execution, and improvement.

## Template Structure

### Process Metadata
**Process Name:** [Descriptive name of the process]  
**Domain:** [Primary knowledge domain this process belongs to]  
**Process Type:** [Operational, Strategic, Analytical, Creative, etc.]  
**Complexity Level:** [Basic, Intermediate, Advanced]  
**Last Updated:** [Date in YYYY-MM-DD format]  
**Process Owner:** [Role or entity responsible for this process]  

### Process Summary
**Purpose:** [Concise statement of what this process aims to achieve]

**Scope:** [Clear boundaries of what this process includes and excludes]

**Expected Outcomes:** [Specific results or deliverables produced by this process]

### Process Flow
**Prerequisites:** [Conditions, resources, or inputs required before starting]
- [Prerequisite 1]

  - Solution: [How to address it]
- Issue: [Description of common problem]
  - Solution: [How to address it]

**Verification Methods:** [How to verify that the process was executed correctly]

### Process Variations
**Alternative Paths:** [Describe any alternative routes through the process]

**Adaptations:** [How this process might be adapted for different contexts]

### Integration Points
**Upstream Processes:** [Processes that feed into this one]

**Downstream Processes:** [Processes that this one feeds into]

## Usage Notes
- Use this template for documenting any repeatable sequence of actions
- Ensure steps are detailed enough for someone unfamiliar with the process to follow
- Include decision points and conditional paths where applicable
- Update the "Last Updated" field whenever significant changes are made
- Cross-reference with related processes in the Knowledge Base

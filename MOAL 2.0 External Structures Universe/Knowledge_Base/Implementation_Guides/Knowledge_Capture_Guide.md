# Knowledge Capture Guide

## Overview
This guide provides a systematic approach to capturing knowledge within the MOAL 2.0 Knowledge Base. Effective knowledge capture is the foundation of a valuable Knowledge Base, ensuring that insights, information, and expertise are preserved in a structured, retrievable format that supports the Knowledge Nexus component of MOAL 2.0.

## When to Capture Knowledge

Knowledge capture should be triggered by the following events or situations:

1. **New Insights**: When you or your AI collaborator discover new information or develop new understanding
2. **Problem Solving**: After successfully solving a complex problem
3. **Decision Making**: After making significant decisions, especially those that might be relevant to future situations
4. **Learning**: After acquiring new skills or understanding new concepts
5. **Project Completion**: At the conclusion of projects to document lessons learned
6. **External Information**: When encountering valuable external information that should be preserved
7. **Pattern Recognition**: When identifying patterns or connections across different domains
8. **Expertise Application**: When applying specialized expertise to a situation

## Knowledge Capture Process

### 1. Identify Knowledge Worth Capturing

Not all information warrants formal capture. Evaluate potential knowledge using these criteria:

- **Reusability**: Will this knowledge be useful in future situations?
- **Uniqueness**: Is this knowledge not easily found elsewhere?
- **Accuracy**: Is this knowledge verified and reliable?
- **Relevance**: Does this knowledge align with your areas of focus?
- **Longevity**: Will this knowledge remain valuable over time?

### 2. Select the Appropriate Template

Choose the most suitable template based on the type of knowledge:

- **Concept Definition Template**: For fundamental ideas, theories, or principles
- **Process Documentation Template**: For procedures, methods, or sequences of actions
- **Reference Collection Template**: For compilations of related resources or references
- **Case Study Template**: For documenting specific applications or instances
- **Decision Record Template**: For capturing decision rationales and contexts

### 3. Structure the Knowledge

When filling in the selected template:

- **Be Comprehensive**: Include all relevant aspects of the knowledge
- **Be Precise**: Use clear, specific language
- **Provide Context**: Explain when and why this knowledge is applicable
- **Include Examples**: Illustrate abstract concepts with concrete examples
- **Add Metadata**: Include tags, categories, and other metadata to facilitate retrieval
- **Link to Related Knowledge**: Reference other items in the Knowledge Base when relevant

### 4. Review and Refine

Before finalizing the knowledge capture:

- **Verify Accuracy**: Double-check facts and information
- **Ensure Clarity**: Make sure the content is understandable to the intended audience
- **Check Completeness**: Confirm that all relevant aspects are covered
- **Validate Structure**: Ensure the knowledge fits the template structure
- **Eliminate Redundancy**: Remove unnecessary repetition

### 5. Integrate into Knowledge Base

After capturing the knowledge:

- **Select Appropriate Location**: Place the knowledge in the relevant section of the Knowledge Base
- **Update Indexes**: Ensure the knowledge is properly indexed for retrieval
- **Create Necessary Links**: Connect to related knowledge items
- **Update Knowledge Maps**: If using semantic networks or knowledge graphs, integrate the new knowledge

## Special Considerations

### Capturing Tacit Knowledge

Tacit knowledge (knowledge that is difficult to articulate) requires special approaches:

- **Use Storytelling**: Capture experiences and context through narratives
- **Document Decision Processes**: Record not just what was decided, but how and why
- **Include Heuristics**: Document rules of thumb and intuitive approaches
- **Capture Analogies**: Record metaphors and analogies that help explain concepts
- **Document Expert Perspectives**: Include viewpoints and insights from domain experts

### Collaborative Knowledge Capture

When capturing knowledge collaboratively with an AI:

- **Leverage AI Strengths**: Use AI for organizing, structuring, and connecting information
- **Provide Human Context**: Add human perspectives, values, and experiential insights
- **Iterative Refinement**: Use dialogue to progressively refine knowledge representation
- **Cross-Validation**: Have both human and AI verify the accuracy and completeness
- **Complementary Expertise**: Combine human domain expertise with AI's information processing capabilities

### Knowledge Capture from External Sources

When capturing knowledge from external sources:

- **Cite Sources**: Always include proper attribution and references
- **Evaluate Credibility**: Assess the reliability of the source
- **Distinguish Facts from Opinions**: Clearly separate factual information from interpretations
- **Respect Intellectual Property**: Ensure compliance with copyright and intellectual property laws
- **Synthesize Multiple Sources**: Integrate information from multiple sources when appropriate

## Tools and Techniques

### Documentation Tools
- Text editors with Markdown support
- Knowledge base software
- Note-taking applications with tagging capabilities
- Mind mapping software
- Graph database tools for knowledge graphs

### Capture Techniques
- **Structured Interviews**: For extracting knowledge from experts
- **Observation**: For capturing procedural knowledge
- **Think-Aloud Protocols**: For capturing decision-making processes
- **Concept Mapping**: For visualizing relationships between ideas
- **After-Action Reviews**: For capturing lessons learned
- **Critical Incident Technique**: For capturing knowledge from significant events

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Knowledge is Too Complex
**Solution**: Break down into smaller, interconnected components and use multiple templates if necessary

### Challenge: Knowledge is Highly Technical
**Solution**: Include both technical details and simplified explanations; use visual aids when helpful

### Challenge: Knowledge is Rapidly Changing
**Solution**: Focus on capturing principles and approaches rather than specific details; include update mechanisms

### Challenge: Knowledge is Highly Contextual
**Solution**: Document the context thoroughly; include scenarios where the knowledge applies

### Challenge: Difficulty Articulating Knowledge
**Solution**: Use multiple representation formats; iterate through drafts; collaborate with others

## Integration with MOAL 2.0

Effective knowledge capture directly supports the Knowledge Nexus component of MOAL 2.0 by:

- Providing structured information that can be accessed and applied by expertise facets
- Supporting knowledge synthesis across different domains
- Enabling the application of captured knowledge to new contexts
- Facilitating continuous learning and improvement

## Next Steps

After capturing knowledge:
1. Use the **Knowledge Organization Guide** to ensure proper integration into the Knowledge Base structure
2. Refer to the **Knowledge Evolution Guide** for approaches to keeping the knowledge current
3. Consult the **Knowledge Integration Guide** for connecting knowledge across domains
4. Apply the **Knowledge Validation Guide** to verify quality and accuracy

Remember that knowledge capture is not a one-time activity but an ongoing process that builds and refines your Knowledge Base over time.

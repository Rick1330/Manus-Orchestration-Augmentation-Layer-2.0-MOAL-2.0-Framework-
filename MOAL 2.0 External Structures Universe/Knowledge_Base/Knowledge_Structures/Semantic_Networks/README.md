# Semantic Networks

## Overview
Semantic Networks represent a knowledge organization approach within the MOAL 2.0 Knowledge Base that focuses on meaningful relationships between concepts. Unlike hierarchical structures, semantic networks allow for diverse relationship types and multi-directional connections, creating a web of interrelated knowledge.

## Characteristics
- **Network Structure**: Information is organized as nodes (concepts) connected by labeled edges (relationships)
- **Diverse Relationships**: Supports multiple types of relationships beyond simple parent-child connections
- **Multi-Directional**: Allows connections in any direction between related concepts
- **Contextual Understanding**: Captures how concepts relate to each other in meaningful ways
- **Flexible Association**: Enables discovery of indirect relationships through network traversal

## Common Types
1. **Concept Maps**: Visual representations of relationships between concepts
2. **Associative Networks**: Networks based on associative relationships between concepts
3. **Propositional Networks**: Networks where relationships form propositions or statements
4. **Causal Networks**: Networks representing cause-effect relationships
5. **Dependency Networks**: Networks showing how concepts depend on or support each other

## When to Use
- When relationships between concepts are diverse and complex
- When knowledge discovery through association is important
- When representing knowledge that doesn't fit neatly into hierarchies
- When modeling domain expertise with nuanced relationships
- When supporting creative thinking and novel connections

## Limitations
- Can become visually complex and difficult to navigate
- May require specialized tools for effective visualization and navigation
- More challenging to maintain consistency than simpler structures
- Requires careful definition of relationship types
- May be more difficult for users to understand initially

## Examples in This Directory
1. **Domain_Concept_Network_Example.md**: Demonstrates a semantic network of related concepts in a domain
2. **Problem_Solution_Network_Example.md**: Shows a network of problems, solutions, and their relationships
3. **Interdisciplinary_Connection_Map_Example.md**: Illustrates connections across different disciplines

## Integration with MOAL 2.0
Semantic Networks serve as powerful knowledge structures in the MOAL 2.0 Knowledge Base. They can be:
- Representations of expertise facet relationships
- Tools for discovering novel connections between knowledge domains
- Structures for mapping interdisciplinary knowledge
- Foundations for creative problem-solving approaches
- Supports for systems thinking and complex analysis

## Best Practices
- Define a clear vocabulary of relationship types
- Balance comprehensiveness with usability
- Use visual representations when possible
- Provide navigation aids for complex networks
- Consider how the network will be traversed and queried
- Regularly review and refine relationship definitions

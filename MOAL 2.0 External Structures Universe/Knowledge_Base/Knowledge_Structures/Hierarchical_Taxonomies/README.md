# Hierarchical Taxonomies

## Overview
Hierarchical Taxonomies represent a structured approach to knowledge organization within the MOAL 2.0 Knowledge Base. They organize information in parent-child relationships, creating a tree-like structure that enables both broad categorization and specific classification.

## Characteristics
- **Tree Structure**: Information is organized in a hierarchical parent-child format
- **Nested Categories**: Items are classified at multiple levels of specificity
- **Clear Inheritance**: Child nodes inherit properties from parent nodes
- **Navigable Structure**: Users can move up and down the hierarchy to find information
- **Scalable Organization**: Can accommodate growing knowledge bases while maintaining structure

## Common Types
1. **Classification Hierarchies**: Organize items based on shared characteristics
2. **Part-Whole Hierarchies**: Represent compositional relationships
3. **Type Hierarchies**: Organize concepts by type and subtype relationships
4. **Functional Hierarchies**: Organize items based on their functions or purposes
5. **Evolutionary Hierarchies**: Represent developmental or historical relationships

## When to Use
- When information has natural parent-child relationships
- For organizing large volumes of information that need clear categorization
- When users need to navigate from general to specific information
- When inheritance of properties or attributes is important
- For creating standardized vocabularies and classification systems

## Limitations
- May oversimplify complex relationships that aren't strictly hierarchical
- Can become rigid and difficult to reorganize as knowledge evolves
- Limited ability to represent cross-cutting relationships
- May require deep domain knowledge to create effective hierarchies
- Can become unwieldy with very deep hierarchies

## Examples in This Directory
1. **Domain_Knowledge_Taxonomy_Example.md**: Demonstrates a hierarchical organization of knowledge domains
2. **Skill_Classification_Hierarchy_Example.md**: Shows a taxonomy of skills and competencies
3. **Project_Decomposition_Example.md**: Illustrates a part-whole hierarchy for project management

## Integration with MOAL 2.0
Hierarchical Taxonomies serve as organizing structures in the MOAL 2.0 Knowledge Base. They can be:
- Frameworks for organizing expertise facets
- Structures for classifying process templates
- Navigation systems for accessing domain knowledge
- Tools for decomposing complex problems or projects
- Foundations for more complex knowledge representations

## Best Practices
- Ensure consistent principles for parent-child relationships
- Limit hierarchy depth to practical levels (typically 5-7 levels)
- Use clear, descriptive labels for each node
- Provide definitions for categories to ensure consistent application
- Allow for controlled evolution as knowledge domains expand
- Consider how to handle items that could belong in multiple categories

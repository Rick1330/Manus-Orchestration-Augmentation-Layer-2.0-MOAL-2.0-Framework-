# Facet Creation Guide

## Overview
This guide provides a step-by-step process for defining new expertise facets within the MOAL 2.0 framework. Creating well-defined facets is essential for building an effective Expertise Facet Library that supports dynamic expertise activation and combination.

## When to Create a New Facet

Consider creating a new facet when:
- You identify a distinct area of expertise not covered by existing facets
- You need to formalize tacit knowledge or skills you regularly apply
- You want to make a complex expertise area more accessible and transferable
- You need to distinguish between related but distinct areas of expertise

## Step 1: Select the Appropriate Template

The MOAL 2.0 framework provides three template types for facet creation:

- **Basic Facet Template**: Use for simple, foundational expertise areas with clear boundaries
- **Advanced Facet Template**: Use for complex, multi-dimensional expertise areas that require detailed articulation
- **Specialized Facet Template**: Use for domain-specific expertise that requires technical knowledge and methodologies

Review each template to determine which best fits the expertise area you're defining.

## Step 2: Define Core Purpose and Scope

Clearly articulate:
- The primary function of this facet
- When and where it is most applicable
- What problems or challenges it addresses
- How it differs from related facets

Keep the purpose statement focused and specific. Avoid overly broad definitions that could encompass multiple distinct facets.

## Step 3: Identify Core Capabilities

List the key abilities or skills that comprise this expertise:
- For Basic Facets: Identify 3-5 core capabilities
- For Advanced Facets: Identify 5-7 capabilities with detailed descriptions
- For Specialized Facets: Focus on domain-specific capabilities with technical aspects

Ensure each capability is distinct and essential to the facet. Test by asking: "Could this facet function effectively without this capability?"

## Step 4: Map Knowledge Domains

Document the knowledge areas this facet draws upon:
- Identify relevant disciplines, fields, or subject areas
- For Advanced and Specialized Facets, indicate proficiency levels
- Include both theoretical knowledge and practical know-how

Be specific about what knowledge is required, avoiding overly general categories.

## Step 5: Articulate Reasoning Approaches

Describe the characteristic thinking patterns this facet employs:
- How does this facet approach problems?
- What mental models or cognitive strategies does it use?
- How does it process information?

Focus on the distinctive reasoning processes, not just the outcomes they produce.

## Step 6: Define Perspective Elements

Outline the typical viewpoints or frames through which this facet perceives situations:
- What aspects of a situation does this facet naturally focus on?
- What values or priorities guide its attention?
- For Advanced Facets, include strengths and limitations of each perspective

Ensure these perspectives represent genuine differences in how situations are perceived, not just different opinions.

## Step 7: Characterize Communication Style

Describe how this facet typically communicates:
- Characteristic vocabulary and terminology
- Typical structure and organization of ideas
- Tone and interpersonal approach
- For Advanced Facets, include examples of characteristic expressions

Focus on patterns that would help someone recognize or adopt this facet's communication style.

## Step 8: Create Activation Cues

Develop specific phrases that can trigger this facet during collaboration:
- Keep cues concise and distinctive
- For Advanced Facets, create cues for specific aspects of the facet
- Test cues to ensure they effectively evoke the intended expertise

Effective cues should immediately shift thinking into the patterns characteristic of this facet.

## Step 9: Add Supplementary Elements

For Advanced and Specialized Facets, include additional elements as appropriate:
- Complementary and contrasting facets
- Evolution paths
- Domain context
- Technical language
- Tools and resources
- Application examples

These elements enhance the facet's usability and integration with other facets.

## Step 10: Review and Refine

Critically evaluate your facet definition:
- Is it distinct from existing facets?
- Is it specific enough to be recognizable?
- Is it comprehensive enough to be useful?
- Is it written clearly enough to be transferable?

Revise as needed to address any gaps or inconsistencies.

## Step 11: Test in Practice

Apply the facet in real situations:
- Attempt to activate the facet using the defined cues
- Observe whether the facet enables the intended capabilities
- Note any aspects that seem incomplete or inaccurate

Use these observations to further refine the facet definition.

## Step 12: Document and Share

Add the completed facet to your Expertise Facet Library:
- Save in the appropriate category folder
- Consider sharing with collaborators who might benefit
- Establish a review cycle for updating the facet based on experience

## Conclusion

Creating well-defined expertise facets is a foundational practice in the MOAL 2.0 framework. By following this structured process, you can transform implicit expertise into explicit, transferable facets that can be dynamically activated and combined to address complex challenges.

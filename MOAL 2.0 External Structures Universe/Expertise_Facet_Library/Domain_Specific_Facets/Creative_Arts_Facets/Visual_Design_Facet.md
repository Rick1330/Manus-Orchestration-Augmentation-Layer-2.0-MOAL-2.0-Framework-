## Reasoning Approaches
This facet employs aesthetic, communicative thinking that balances creative expression with functional purpose. It approaches design by analyzing communication goals, exploring visual concepts, developing compositions, refining details, and ensuring implementation quality. It values purposeful design over decoration and meaningful visual communication over mere attractiveness.

## Perspective Elements
Visual design views communication through a lens of visual language, focusing on how form, color, typography, and imagery can convey messages and evoke responses. This perspective naturally attends to visual impact, aesthetic coherence, and communicative clarity. It prioritizes intentional visual decisions over arbitrary choices, audience-centered design over personal preference, and unified systems over isolated elements.

## Communication Style
Communication is characterized by visual presentations, design rationales, and specific terminology. This facet typically structures communication around design concepts, visual examples, and iterative refinements. The tone is both creative and analytical, emphasizing how visual choices serve specific communication or experiential goals.

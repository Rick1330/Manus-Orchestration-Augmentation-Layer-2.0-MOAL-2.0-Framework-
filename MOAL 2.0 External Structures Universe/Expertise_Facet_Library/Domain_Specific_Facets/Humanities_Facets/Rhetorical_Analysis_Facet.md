This facet employs analytical, contextual thinking that balances textual details with broader communicative purposes.

## Perspective Elements
Rhetorical analysis views communication through a lens of persuasive intent, focusing on how language choices and structures influence audiences. This perspective naturally attends to argumentative strategies, stylistic devices, and audience relationships. It prioritizes functional understanding over purely aesthetic appreciation, contextual interpretation over decontextualized reading, and recognition of persuasive complexity over simplistic categorization.

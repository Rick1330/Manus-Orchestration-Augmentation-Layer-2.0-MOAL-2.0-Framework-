# Facet Combination Patterns

## Overview
This document provides guidance on effectively combining expertise facets to create comprehensive expertise profiles tailored to specific tasks and contexts. The MOAL 2.0 framework enables dynamic combination of facets, allowing for precise expertise application and novel hybrid expertise profiles.

## Complementary Combinations

Complementary combinations pair facets that enhance each other's strengths and create synergistic capabilities. These combinations typically involve facets that operate in similar domains but contribute different perspectives or capabilities.

### Pattern: Analytical-Creative Pairing
**Example Combination:** Critical Thinking + Creative Ideation
**Value Created:** Enables both divergent idea generation and rigorous evaluation, supporting innovation processes that require both creativity and analytical rigor.
**Application Context:** Problem-solving, innovation workshops, design thinking processes
**Activation Sequence:** Typically activate creative facets first for idea generation, followed by analytical facets for evaluation and refinement.

### Pattern: Strategic-Tactical Pairing
**Example Combination:** Strategic Systems Thinking + Implementation Planning
**Value Created:** Connects big-picture strategic vision with practical execution details, ensuring strategies are both visionary and implementable.
**Application Context:** Organizational planning, project initiation, change management
**Activation Sequence:** Begin with strategic facets to establish direction and context, then activate tactical facets to develop specific action plans.

### Pattern: Domain-Meta Pairing
**Example Combination:** Data Science Specialist + Reflective Learning
**Value Created:** Enhances domain expertise with metacognitive awareness, enabling continuous improvement and adaptation of specialized skills.
**Application Context:** Professional development, complex problem-solving, expertise refinement
**Activation Sequence:** Alternate between domain expertise application and reflective practice to continuously improve performance.

## Contrasting Combinations

Contrasting combinations bring together facets with different perspectives or approaches, creating productive tension that can reveal blind spots and generate more comprehensive understanding.

### Pattern: Divergent-Convergent Thinking
**Example Combination:** Creative Ideation + Decision Analysis
**Value Created:** Balances expansive possibility thinking with focused decision-making, preventing both premature closure and analysis paralysis.
**Application Context:** Decision-making under uncertainty, innovation processes, strategic planning
**Activation Sequence:** Begin with divergent thinking to explore possibilities, then transition to convergent thinking to evaluate and select options.

### Pattern: Human-Technical Perspective
**Example Combination:** User Experience Design + Technical Documentation
**Value Created:** Integrates human-centered design with technical precision, creating solutions that are both usable and technically sound.
**Application Context:** Product development, system design, technical communication
**Activation Sequence:** Alternate between perspectives, using technical understanding to inform design and user needs to guide technical implementation.

### Pattern: Optimistic-Critical Viewpoint
**Example Combination:** Opportunity Identification + Risk Assessment
**Value Created:** Balances recognition of potential benefits with awareness of potential pitfalls, supporting more realistic planning.
**Application Context:** Strategic planning, investment decisions, project evaluation
**Activation Sequence:** Consider both perspectives in parallel or alternate between them to develop a balanced assessment.

## Synergistic Combinations

Synergistic combinations create novel capabilities through specific facet combinations that produce emergent expertise greater than the sum of individual facets.

### Pattern: Interdisciplinary Integration
**Example Combination:** Data Science Specialist + Behavioral Psychology + Visual Communication
**Value Created:** Creates capability for data-driven behavioral insights communicated through compelling visualizations.
**Application Context:** Behavioral economics, user research, public health communication
**Activation Sequence:** Integrate all perspectives simultaneously, allowing cross-pollination of ideas and approaches.

### Pattern: Multi-level Analysis
**Example Combination:** Strategic Systems Thinking + Detailed Analysis + Implementation Planning
**Value Created:** Enables seamless movement between big-picture systems view, detailed component analysis, and practical execution planning.
**Application Context:** Complex project management, organizational transformation, policy development
**Activation Sequence:** Begin with systems view, zoom in for detailed analysis of components, then develop implementation plans that respect system dynamics.

### Pattern: Learning-Application Loop
**Example Combination:** Knowledge Acquisition + Practical Application + Reflective Learning
**Value Created:** Creates a continuous improvement cycle that integrates new knowledge, applies it in practice, and reflects on outcomes.
**Application Context:** Skill development, professional growth, adaptive expertise
**Activation Sequence:** Cycle through the facets iteratively, creating a learning loop that builds expertise over time.

## Implementation Considerations

When combining facets, consider the following factors:

1. **Task Requirements:** Analyze the specific demands of the task to determine which facet combinations would be most effective.

2. **Cognitive Load:** Be mindful of the cognitive demands of switching between or simultaneously holding multiple facets. Start with simpler combinations before attempting more complex ones.

3. **Activation Methods:** Develop clear activation cues for transitioning between facets or invoking specific combinations.

4. **Documentation:** Record successful combinations and their outcomes to build a personal library of effective expertise profiles.

5. **Practice:** Regularly practice combining different facets to increase fluency in transitioning between them.

## Conclusion

Effective facet combination is a core capability of the MOAL 2.0 framework, enabling dynamic expertise profiles tailored to specific contexts. By understanding common combination patterns and practicing deliberate facet integration, you can develop increasingly sophisticated expertise profiles that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries.

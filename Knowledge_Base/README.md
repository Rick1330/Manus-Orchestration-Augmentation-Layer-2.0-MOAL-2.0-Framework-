# MOAL 2.0 Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base is a critical component of the MOAL 2.0 External Structures Universe, serving as an organized repository of information, insights, and references that support MOAL 2.0 operations. It provides the foundation for the Knowledge Nexus component and evolves through continuous curation.

## Structure

The Knowledge Base is organized into the following key areas:

1. **Knowledge_Structures**: Examples and guides for different knowledge organization structures (Simple Collections, Hierarchical Taxonomies, Semantic Networks, Knowledge Graphs) applied to specific niches.

2. **Domain_Knowledge**: Domain-specific knowledge organized into niches within broader categories:
   - Business Knowledge
   - Technical Knowledge
   - Scientific Knowledge
   - Creative Knowledge
   - Humanities Knowledge

3. **Meta_Knowledge**: Resources related to learning, research, and knowledge integration within specific niches.

4. **Knowledge_Templates**: Templates for consistent knowledge representation across the Knowledge Base.

5. **Retrieval_Patterns**: Documentation and examples of how knowledge within specific niches can be effectively retrieved and synthesized.

6. **Implementation_Guides**: Guides for implementing and utilizing the Knowledge Base within the MOAL 2.0 framework.

## Development Focus

The current development focus is on creating a **highly structured, intensively populated, and niche-specific Knowledge Base** with:

1. **Deep Structure**: Expanding the existing Knowledge Base architecture with more detailed sections and subsections.
2. **Niche Specificity**: Focusing on specific niches within each domain category, rather than general examples.
3. **Intensive Population**: Creating at least 5-7 distinct, detailed knowledge files within each niche-specific subcategory.

## Integration

The Knowledge Base is designed to integrate with:
- The Expertise Facet Library, providing foundational knowledge for expertise activation
- Process Templates, supporting standardized workflows and decision frameworks

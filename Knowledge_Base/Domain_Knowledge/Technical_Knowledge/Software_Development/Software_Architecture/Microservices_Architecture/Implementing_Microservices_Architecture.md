   - Consider business priorities and technical feasibility

2. **Create Façade**:
   - Implement a façade or API gateway
   - Route requests between monolith and microservices
   - Ensure transparent operation for clients

3. **Extract Services Incrementally**:
   - Move functionality one bounded context at a time
   - Maintain backward compatibility
   - Validate each extraction thoroughly

4. **Decommission Monolith Components**:
   - Remove extracted functionality from monolith
   - Update routing to direct all traffic to new services
   - Eventually retire the monolith completely

#### Branch by Abstraction

1. **Create Abstraction Layer**:
   - Implement an abstraction over the functionality to be extracted
   - Ensure all code uses this abstraction
   - Maintain the original implementation initially

2. **Create New Implementation**:
   - Develop a new implementation using microservices
   - Test thoroughly in isolation
   - Ensure feature parity with original implementation

3. **Switch Implementations**:
   - Gradually switch to the new implementation
   - Use feature flags to control the transition
   - Monitor for issues and be prepared to roll back

4. **Remove Old Implementation**:
   - Once the new implementation is stable, remove the old code
   - Clean up the abstraction if no longer needed
   - Complete the migration for this component

### Team Organization Patterns

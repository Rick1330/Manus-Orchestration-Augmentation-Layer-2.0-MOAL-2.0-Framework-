## Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive collection of design patterns commonly used in microservices architecture. It serves as a reference guide for architects and developers designing, building, and evolving microservice-based systems within the MOAL 2.0 framework, offering solutions to recurring problems and promoting best practices.

## Introduction

Microservices architecture, while offering benefits like agility and scalability, introduces unique challenges related to decomposition, communication, data management, deployment, and resilience. Design patterns provide proven, reusable solutions to these common problems, helping teams build robust and maintainable microservice systems.

This reference collection categorizes patterns based on the problem area they address:

1.  **Decomposition Patterns**: How to break down a system into microservices.
2.  **Integration Patterns**: How services communicate and interact.
3.  **Data Management Patterns**: How to manage data consistency and queries across services.
4.  **Deployment Patterns**: How to deploy and manage microservices.
5.  **Cross-Cutting Concerns Patterns**: How to handle concerns like observability, security, and configuration.
6.  **Resilience Patterns**: How to build fault-tolerant systems.

## 1. Decomposition Patterns

These patterns help decide how to break down a monolithic application or design a new system as microservices.

### 1.1 Decompose by Business Capability

**Problem**: How to define the boundaries and responsibilities of microservices?

**Solution**: Define services corresponding to business capabilities. A business capability is something the business does to generate value (e.g., Order Management, Inventory Management, Customer Management).

**Benefits**:
- Aligns services with business structure.
- Creates stable service boundaries.
- Promotes cross-functional teams owning capabilities end-to-end.

**Considerations**:
- Requires good understanding of the business domain.
- Identifying capabilities can be challenging.

**Example**: An e-commerce application decomposed into services like Product Catalog, Order Management, Payment, Shipping, and Customer Accounts.

### 1.2 Decompose by Subdomain (Domain-Driven Design)

**Problem**: How to apply Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to microservice decomposition?

**Solution**: Define services corresponding to DDD subdomains and bounded contexts. Each bounded context, representing a specific part of the larger domain with its own ubiquitous language, becomes a candidate for a microservice.

**Benefits**:
- Strong alignment with domain complexity.
- Clear boundaries based on linguistic differences.
- Encourages modeling the core domain effectively.

**Considerations**:
- Requires expertise in DDD.
- Identifying bounded contexts can be complex.

**Example**: A shipping logistics system might have bounded contexts (and services) for Route Planning, Shipment Tracking, Carrier Integration, and Billing.

### 1.3 Strangler Fig Pattern

**Problem**: How to incrementally migrate a monolithic application to microservices without a big-bang rewrite?

**Solution**: Gradually create new microservices that replace specific pieces of functionality from the monolith. Route traffic to the new services, progressively "strangling" the monolith until it can be decommissioned.

**Benefits**:
- Reduces migration risk.
- Allows incremental value delivery.
- Spreads migration effort over time.

**Considerations**:
- Requires careful management of routing and data synchronization.
- Can lead to a complex hybrid state during migration.

**Example**: Replacing the monolith's reporting module with a new microservice, routing reporting requests to the new service while other requests still go to the monolith.

### 1.4 Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)

**Problem**: How to prevent a new microservice's domain model from being corrupted by the legacy monolith's model during migration or integration?

**Solution**: Implement an ACL as a translation layer between the new microservice and the legacy system. The ACL translates requests and data between the two different models, protecting the integrity of the new service's domain.

**Benefits**:
- Isolates the new service from legacy complexities.
- Facilitates communication between different domain models.
- Enables independent evolution of the new service.

**Considerations**:
- Adds complexity and potential latency.
- Requires maintenance as both systems evolve.

**Example**: An ACL translating legacy customer data structures into the format expected by a new Customer Management microservice.

## 2. Integration Patterns

These patterns address how microservices communicate and interact with each other and external clients.

### 2.1 API Gateway

**Problem**: How should clients access individual microservices without knowing their specific locations or dealing with multiple endpoints?

**Solution**: Implement an API Gateway that acts as a single entry point for all client requests. It routes requests to appropriate backend services, aggregates responses, and handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate limiting, and protocol translation.

**Benefits**:
- Simplifies client interaction.
- Encapsulates internal system structure.
- Centralizes cross-cutting concerns.
- Can optimize communication (e.g., request aggregation).

**Considerations**:
- Can become a bottleneck or single point of failure if not designed well.
- Requires careful management and scaling.

**Example**: A mobile app interacts with a single API Gateway endpoint, which routes requests to User, Product, and Order services.

### 2.2 Backend For Frontend (BFF)

**Problem**: How to provide optimized APIs for different types of clients (e.g., web, mobile, desktop) when a single API Gateway becomes too generic?

**Solution**: Implement separate API Gateways (BFFs) for each type of frontend client. Each BFF provides an API tailored to the specific needs and constraints of its client type.

**Benefits**:
- Optimized APIs for specific client needs.
- Teams can develop BFFs independently.
- Reduces payload size and complexity for clients.

**Considerations**:
- Increases the number of gateways to manage.
- Potential for code duplication across BFFs.

**Example**: Separate BFFs for a mobile app and a web application, each calling the same backend microservices but providing different data formats and aggregations.

### 2.3 Service Discovery

**Problem**: How can services find the network locations (IP address, port) of other services, especially in dynamic environments with auto-scaling and container orchestration?

**Solution**: Implement a Service Discovery mechanism. Services register their locations upon startup, and clients query the registry to find service instances.

**Patterns**:
- **Client-Side Discovery**: Client queries the registry and chooses an instance (e.g., Netflix Eureka).
- **Server-Side Discovery**: Client requests go through a router/load balancer that queries the registry (e.g., Kubernetes Services, AWS ELB).

**Benefits**:
- Handles dynamic service locations.
- Enables load balancing and resilience.

**Considerations**:
- Requires a highly available service registry.
- Adds complexity to the infrastructure.

### 2.4 Asynchronous Messaging

**Problem**: How to decouple services and improve resilience by avoiding direct synchronous calls?

**Solution**: Use asynchronous messaging patterns for inter-service communication.

**Patterns**:
- **Message Queue**: Point-to-point communication.
- **Publish/Subscribe**: One-to-many communication.
- **Event Streaming**: Continuous flow of events.

**Benefits**:
- Increased resilience (services can operate if others are down).
- Improved scalability (consumers can process messages at their own pace).
- Loose coupling between services.

**Considerations**:
- Adds complexity (message brokers, eventual consistency).
- Debugging distributed flows can be harder.

**Example**: An Order service publishes an `OrderPlaced` event to a Kafka topic, which is consumed by Payment, Inventory, and Notification services.

### 2.5 Idempotent Receiver

**Problem**: How to handle duplicate messages that might be delivered in asynchronous systems?

**Solution**: Design message consumers to be idempotent, meaning processing the same message multiple times produces the same result as processing it once. This can be achieved by tracking processed message IDs or designing operations to be inherently idempotent.

**Benefits**:
- Increases system reliability in the face of message delivery issues.
- Simplifies error handling and retry logic.

**Considerations**:
- Requires careful design of consumer logic.
- May require maintaining state about processed messages.

**Example**: A payment service checks if a payment for a specific `orderId` (from the message) has already been processed before attempting processing again.

## 3. Data Management Patterns

These patterns address the challenges of managing data consistency and querying across multiple microservices.

### 3.1 Database per Service

**Problem**: How to ensure loose coupling and independent evolution of services regarding their data?

**Solution**: Each microservice owns and manages its private database. Other services can only access this data through the owning service's API.

**Benefits**:
- Enforces loose coupling.
- Allows services to choose the best database technology for their needs (polyglot persistence).
- Enables independent schema evolution.

**Considerations**:
- Makes implementing queries and transactions that span multiple services complex.
- Requires strategies for maintaining data consistency across services.

**Example**: User service uses PostgreSQL, Product service uses MongoDB, Order service uses Cassandra.

### 3.2 Shared Database

**Problem**: When is it acceptable for multiple services to share a single database?

**Solution**: (Anti-pattern, generally discouraged) Multiple services access the same database schema directly. This pattern is sometimes used as an intermediate step during migration but should generally be avoided.

**Benefits**:
- Simpler for transactions spanning services.
- Easier to implement initially.

**Considerations**:
- Creates tight coupling between services.
- Hinders independent deployment and scaling.
- Makes schema evolution difficult.

### 3.3 Saga Pattern

**Problem**: How to manage data consistency across multiple services in the absence of distributed transactions (which are often avoided in microservices)?

**Solution**: Implement a Saga, which is a sequence of local transactions. Each local transaction updates data within a single service and publishes an event or message that triggers the next local transaction in the saga. If a step fails, compensating transactions are executed to undo the preceding steps.

**Types**:
- **Choreography**: Services coordinate by publishing/subscribing to events.
- **Orchestration**: A central coordinator tells services what local transactions to execute.

**Benefits**:
- Maintains data consistency across services without distributed locking.
- Improves resilience by handling partial failures.

**Considerations**:
- Increases complexity of application logic.
- Debugging sagas can be challenging.
- Requires careful design of compensating actions.

**Example**: An order placement saga involving Order, Payment, and Inventory services, with compensating actions like refunding payment or releasing inventory if a step fails.

### 3.4 Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

**Problem**: How to optimize data models for both command (write) and query (read) operations, especially when reads require data from multiple services?

**Solution**: Separate the models used for updating state (command model) from the models used for querying state (query model). The command side handles updates and publishes events. The query side listens to these events and maintains one or more denormalized read models optimized for specific query needs.

**Benefits**:
- Allows independent optimization and scaling of read and write paths.
- Simplifies complex query requirements.
- Works well with event sourcing and microservices.

**Considerations**:
- Introduces eventual consistency between command and query models.
- Increases system complexity.
- Requires mechanisms to build and update read models.

**Example**: An Order service handles commands, publishing events that update a separate Order Query service maintaining a denormalized view optimized for displaying order history.

### 3.5 Event Sourcing

**Problem**: How to capture the complete history of state changes and enable reliable state reconstruction?

**Solution**: Persist all changes to an application state as a sequence of immutable events, rather than storing only the current state. The current state can be reconstructed by replaying the events.

**Benefits**:
- Provides a reliable audit log.
- Enables reconstruction of past states.
- Simplifies handling of concurrent updates.
- Facilitates debugging and analysis.

**Considerations**:
- Querying current state can be complex (often combined with CQRS).
- Schema evolution of events requires careful handling.
- Can increase storage requirements.

**Example**: Storing events like `ProductAddedToCart`, `QuantityUpdated`, `OrderSubmitted` instead of just the final order state.

### 3.6 API Composition

**Problem**: How to implement queries that retrieve data scattered across multiple microservices?

**Solution**: Implement a composer (often the API Gateway or a dedicated service) that invokes multiple services and combines their results into a single response for the client.

**Benefits**:
- Hides backend complexity from clients.
- Provides a single point for data aggregation.

**Considerations**:
- Can increase response latency.
- The composer can become complex.
- Potential for cascading failures if backend services are slow or unavailable.

**Example**: An API Gateway fetching customer details from the Customer service and recent orders from the Order service to display a user's profile page.

## 4. Deployment Patterns

These patterns address how to deploy microservices reliably and efficiently.

### 4.1 Multiple Services per Host

**Problem**: How to deploy multiple service instances efficiently?

**Solution**: Deploy multiple service instances on a single physical or virtual host.

**Benefits**:
- Efficient resource utilization.

**Considerations**:
- Potential for resource contention between services.
- Requires careful resource allocation and monitoring.
- Less isolation compared to one service per host/container.

### 4.2 Service per Host / Service per Container

**Problem**: How to achieve better isolation and independent deployment for services?

**Solution**: Deploy each service instance in its own host (VM) or, more commonly, its own container.

**Benefits**:
- Strong isolation (dependencies, resources).
- Simplifies deployment and scaling.
- Consistent environments.

**Considerations**:
- Higher overhead compared to multiple services per host.
- Requires container orchestration.

**Example**: Deploying each microservice instance as a separate Docker container managed by Kubernetes.

### 4.3 Service Instance per VM / Container

**Problem**: How to manage multiple instances of the same service for scalability and availability?

**Solution**: Run multiple instances of a service, each in its own VM or container. A load balancer distributes requests across instances.

**Benefits**:
- High availability (failure of one instance doesn't stop the service).
- Scalability (add more instances to handle load).

**Considerations**:
- Requires load balancing and service discovery.

### 4.4 Blue-Green Deployment

**Problem**: How to deploy new versions of services with zero downtime and easy rollback?

**Solution**: Maintain two identical production environments ("blue" and "green"). Deploy the new version to the inactive environment (e.g., green). Once tested, switch traffic from the active environment (blue) to the new one (green). Keep the old environment (blue) ready for quick rollback if needed.

**Benefits**:
- Zero downtime deployments.
- Instant rollback capability.
- Reduces deployment risk.

**Considerations**:
- Requires double the infrastructure resources.
- Managing stateful services can be complex.

### 4.5 Canary Release

**Problem**: How to release new versions to a subset of users to test in production before a full rollout?

**Solution**: Deploy the new version alongside the old one and route a small percentage of traffic (the "canary" group) to the new version. Monitor the canary group closely. Gradually increase traffic to the new version if it performs well, eventually phasing out the old version.

**Benefits**:
- Reduces risk of deploying faulty versions.
- Allows testing with real production traffic.
- Provides early feedback on new features.

**Considerations**:
- Requires sophisticated routing capabilities.
- Monitoring and analysis are critical.
- Managing multiple versions concurrently adds complexity.

## 5. Cross-Cutting Concerns Patterns

These patterns address concerns that affect multiple services.

### 5.1 Externalized Configuration

**Problem**: How to manage configuration settings (e.g., database credentials, feature flags) for multiple services across different environments without hardcoding or complex deployment scripts?

**Solution**: Store configuration externally (e.g., in a configuration server, environment variables, secrets manager). Services load their configuration at startup or runtime.

**Benefits**:
- Centralized configuration management.
- Consistent configuration across environments.
- Enables dynamic configuration updates without redeployment.
- Improves security by separating secrets from code.

**Example**: Using Spring Cloud Config Server, HashiCorp Consul, or Kubernetes ConfigMaps/Secrets.

### 5.2 Service Template / Chassis

**Problem**: How to ensure consistency and avoid boilerplate code for cross-cutting concerns (logging, metrics, health checks, configuration) across multiple microservices?

**Solution**: Create a standardized service template or chassis (framework/library) that provides implementations for common cross-cutting concerns. Teams build their services on top of this template.

**Benefits**:
- Promotes consistency across services.
- Reduces boilerplate code.
- Accelerates development.
- Simplifies maintenance of cross-cutting concerns.

**Considerations**:
- Requires effort to build and maintain the template.
- Can limit technology choices if too rigid.

### 5.3 Centralized Logging

**Problem**: How to effectively monitor and debug issues when logs are scattered across numerous service instances?

**Solution**: Aggregate logs from all service instances into a centralized logging system. Use correlation IDs to trace requests across services.

**Benefits**:
- Single place to search and analyze logs.
- Enables correlation of events across services.
- Facilitates debugging and monitoring.

**Example**: Using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk, or Graylog.

### 5.4 Distributed Tracing

**Problem**: How to understand the flow of requests and identify performance bottlenecks in a distributed system?

**Solution**: Implement distributed tracing. Assign a unique trace ID to each external request. Propagate this ID (and span IDs for individual operations) across service calls. Collect and visualize trace data.

**Benefits**:
- Visualizes request flows across services.
- Helps identify latency bottlenecks.
- Facilitates debugging of distributed issues.

**Example**: Using OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, or Zipkin.

### 5.5 Health Check API

**Problem**: How can infrastructure (e.g., load balancers, orchestrators) determine if a service instance is healthy and ready to receive traffic?

**Solution**: Each service exposes an API endpoint (e.g., `/health`) that returns its health status. The infrastructure periodically calls this endpoint.

**Benefits**:
- Enables automated health monitoring.
- Allows infrastructure to automatically remove unhealthy instances from rotation.
- Facilitates zero-downtime deployments.

**Considerations**:
- Health checks should be meaningful and check dependencies if necessary.

## 6. Resilience Patterns

These patterns help build systems that can tolerate failures.

### 6.1 Circuit Breaker

**Problem**: How to prevent an application from repeatedly trying to invoke a remote service that is failing or slow, which can lead to cascading failures?

**Solution**: Implement a Circuit Breaker proxy around remote calls. If failures exceed a threshold, the breaker "opens," and subsequent calls fail immediately without attempting the remote invocation. After a timeout, the breaker enters a "half-open" state, allowing a limited number of test calls. If successful, the breaker closes; otherwise, it remains open.

**Benefits**:
- Prevents cascading failures.
- Allows failing services time to recover.
- Provides resilience against intermittent issues.

**Example**: Using libraries like Hystrix, Resilience4j, or Polly.

### 6.2 Retry Pattern

**Problem**: How to handle transient failures when communicating with remote services?

**Solution**: Automatically retry failed operations a configurable number of times, often with exponential backoff (increasing delays between retries).

**Benefits**:
- Improves resilience against temporary network glitches or service unavailability.

**Considerations**:
- Should only be used for transient, idempotent operations.
- Requires careful configuration of retry count and backoff strategy.

### 6.3 Timeout Pattern

**Problem**: How to prevent requests from blocking indefinitely while waiting for a response from a slow or unresponsive service?

**Solution**: Configure timeouts for all remote calls. If a response isn't received within the timeout period, the call fails.

**Benefits**:
- Prevents resource exhaustion due to blocked threads.
- Improves system responsiveness.

**Considerations**:
- Choosing appropriate timeout values can be challenging.

### 6.4 Bulkhead Pattern

**Problem**: How can failures in one part of the system be isolated to prevent them from consuming all resources and bringing down the entire system?

**Solution**: Partition system resources (e.g., connection pools, thread pools) based on the services being called. Failure or high load in one partition doesn't affect others.

**Benefits**:
- Isolates failures.
- Improves overall system stability.

**Considerations**:
- Requires careful resource allocation and configuration.

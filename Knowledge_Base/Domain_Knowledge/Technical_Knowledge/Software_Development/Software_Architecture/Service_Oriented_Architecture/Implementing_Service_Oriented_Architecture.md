## Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for implementing Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) in an enterprise environment. It outlines the methodology, best practices, and practical considerations for successfully transitioning to and maintaining an SOA-based system within the MOAL 2.0 framework.

## Introduction

Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural approach that structures applications as collections of loosely coupled, interoperable services. Implementing SOA requires careful planning, appropriate tooling, and a methodical approach to ensure that the resulting architecture delivers on the promised benefits of flexibility, reusability, and business alignment.

This process documentation presents a structured methodology for SOA implementation, covering the entire lifecycle from initial assessment and planning through implementation, testing, deployment, and governance. It provides practical guidance for architects, developers, and IT leaders responsible for SOA initiatives.

The implementation process is organized into phases, with each phase containing specific steps, deliverables, and quality gates. While the process is presented sequentially, in practice, SOA implementation often involves iterative and incremental approaches, with multiple services being developed in parallel and the architecture evolving over time.

## Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive overview of Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), including its core principles, components, patterns, and applications. It serves as a foundational knowledge resource for understanding and implementing event-driven systems within the MOAL 2.0 framework.

## Introduction

Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is a software architecture paradigm that promotes the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events. An event represents a significant change in state or a notable occurrence within a system. In EDA, components communicate with each other by generating and responding to events rather than through direct method calls or tight coupling.

This architectural approach enables the creation of highly decoupled, scalable, and responsive systems that can adapt to changing conditions in real-time. By focusing on events as the primary means of communication, EDA facilitates the development of systems that are more resilient, extensible, and capable of handling complex, asynchronous workflows.

## Core Concepts

### Events

An event is a significant occurrence or change in state within a system. Events have several key characteristics:

1. **Immutability**: Once created, an event cannot be changed. It represents a fact that has occurred at a specific point in time.

2. **Self-Contained**: An event typically contains all the information necessary for its processing, including metadata about when and where it occurred.

3. **Past Tense**: Events represent something that has already happened, not something that might happen in the future.

4. **Notification vs. Command**: Events notify interested parties about something that has occurred, rather than commanding them to take specific actions.

Events can be categorized into several types:

- **Domain Events**: Represent significant occurrences within the business domain (e.g., OrderPlaced, PaymentReceived)
- **Integration Events**: Used for communication between different systems or bounded contexts
- **System Events**: Related to technical aspects of the system (e.g., DatabaseConnectionLost, MemoryThresholdExceeded)
- **User Interface Events**: Triggered by user interactions (e.g., ButtonClicked, FormSubmitted)

### Event Producers and Consumers

- **Event Producers**: Components that detect or create events and publish them to the event channel. Producers are unaware of which consumers (if any) will process their events.

- **Event Consumers**: Components that subscribe to events and react to them when they occur. Consumers can process events synchronously or asynchronously.

The relationship between producers and consumers is many-to-many: a single producer can generate events for multiple consumers, and a single consumer can process events from multiple producers.

### Event Channel

The event channel is the infrastructure that facilitates the transmission of events from producers to consumers. Common implementations include:

- **Message Queues**: Provide point-to-point communication, ensuring that each event is processed by exactly one consumer.
- **Publish-Subscribe Systems**: Allow multiple consumers to receive and process the same event.
- **Event Brokers**: Sophisticated middleware that can route events based on content, handle persistence, and provide additional services.
- **Event Streams**: Ordered sequences of events that can be processed in real-time or replayed from a specific point.

### Event Processing Styles

Event processing can be implemented in various ways:

1. **Simple Event Processing**: Direct handling of individual events without complex analysis or correlation.

2. **Event Stream Processing**: Processing continuous streams of events, often with time-windowing and aggregation.

3. **Complex Event Processing (CEP)**: Analyzing multiple events across time to identify patterns, correlations, and complex situations.

4. **Event Sourcing**: Using events as the primary source of truth, storing all changes to application state as a sequence of events.

## Architectural Patterns

### Publish-Subscribe Pattern

The Publish-Subscribe (Pub-Sub) pattern is a fundamental pattern in EDA where event producers publish events to channels or topics, and event consumers subscribe to those channels to receive events of interest.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Decouples producers from consumers
- Supports one-to-many communication
- Enables dynamic subscription management

**Implementation Example**:
```java
// Publisher
public class OrderService {
    private EventBus eventBus;
    
    public void placeOrder(Order order) {
        // Process order
        // ...
        
        // Publish event
        OrderPlacedEvent event = new OrderPlacedEvent(order.getId(), order.getCustomerId(), order.getItems());
        eventBus.publish("orders", event);
    }
}

// Subscriber
public class NotificationService implements EventHandler<OrderPlacedEvent> {
    public NotificationService(EventBus eventBus) {
        eventBus.subscribe("orders", OrderPlacedEvent.class, this);
    }
    
    @Override
    public void handle(OrderPlacedEvent event) {
        // Send notification to customer
        sendOrderConfirmation(event.getCustomerId(), event.getOrderId());
    }
}
```

### Event Sourcing Pattern

Event Sourcing is a pattern where all changes to application state are stored as a sequence of events. The current state can be reconstructed by replaying these events from the beginning.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Events are the source of truth
- Complete audit trail of all changes
- Ability to reconstruct past states
- Supports temporal queries

**Implementation Example**:
```csharp
public class ShoppingCart {
    private List<CartEvent> events = new List<CartEvent>();
    private Dictionary<string, int> items = new Dictionary<string, int>();
    
    public void AddItem(string productId, int quantity) {
        var event = new ItemAddedEvent(Guid.NewGuid(), DateTime.UtcNow, productId, quantity);
        ApplyEvent(event);
        events.Add(event);
    }
    
    public void RemoveItem(string productId) {
        var event = new ItemRemovedEvent(Guid.NewGuid(), DateTime.UtcNow, productId);
        ApplyEvent(event);
        events.Add(event);
    }
    
    private void ApplyEvent(CartEvent @event) {
        switch (@event) {
            case ItemAddedEvent itemAdded:
                if (items.ContainsKey(itemAdded.ProductId)) {
                    items[itemAdded.ProductId] += itemAdded.Quantity;
                } else {
                    items[itemAdded.ProductId] = itemAdded.Quantity;
                }
                break;
                
            case ItemRemovedEvent itemRemoved:
                if (items.ContainsKey(itemRemoved.ProductId)) {
                    items.Remove(itemRemoved.ProductId);
                }
                break;
        }
    }
    
    public static ShoppingCart Rehydrate(IEnumerable<CartEvent> events) {
        var cart = new ShoppingCart();
        foreach (var @event in events) {
            cart.ApplyEvent(@event);
        }
        cart.events.AddRange(events);
        return cart;
    }
}
```

### Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

CQRS separates read and write operations into different models, allowing each to be optimized independently. It's often used in conjunction with Event Sourcing.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Separate models for commands (writes) and queries (reads)
- Different data stores can be used for each model
- Enables independent scaling and optimization

**Implementation Example**:
```typescript
// Command side
class OrderCommandHandler {
    constructor(private eventStore: EventStore) {}
    
    async handlePlaceOrder(command: PlaceOrderCommand): Promise<void> {
        // Validate command
        if (!command.items || command.items.length === 0) {
            throw new Error("Order must contain at least one item");
        }
        
        // Create and store events
        const event = new OrderPlacedEvent(
            command.orderId,
            command.customerId,
            command.items,
            new Date()
        );
        
        await this.eventStore.saveEvent("order", command.orderId, event);
    }
}

// Query side
class OrderQueryHandler {
    constructor(private readDatabase: Database) {}
    
    async getOrderById(orderId: string): Promise<OrderDto> {
        return this.readDatabase.orders.findOne({ id: orderId });
    }
    
    async getOrdersByCustomer(customerId: string): Promise<OrderDto[]> {
        return this.readDatabase.orders.find({ customerId });
    }
}

// Event handler that updates the read model
class OrderEventHandler {
    constructor(private readDatabase: Database) {}
    
    async handleOrderPlaced(event: OrderPlacedEvent): Promise<void> {
        await this.readDatabase.orders.insert({
            id: event.orderId,
            customerId: event.customerId,
            items: event.items,
            status: "Placed",
            createdAt: event.timestamp
        });
    }
}
```

### Saga Pattern

The Saga pattern manages distributed transactions across multiple services, using a sequence of local transactions and compensating actions to maintain data consistency.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Coordinates multiple services in a distributed transaction
- Uses compensating transactions to handle failures
- Can be choreographed (event-based) or orchestrated (central coordinator)

**Implementation Example (Choreography)**:
```java
// Order Service
public class OrderService {
    private EventBus eventBus;
    private OrderRepository orderRepository;
    
    public void createOrder(Order order) {
        order.setStatus(OrderStatus.PENDING);
        orderRepository.save(order);
        
        // Publish event to start the saga
        eventBus.publish(new OrderCreatedEvent(order.getId(), order.getCustomerId(), order.getAmount()));
    }
    
    // Compensation handler
    @EventHandler
    public void handlePaymentFailedEvent(PaymentFailedEvent event) {
        Order order = orderRepository.findById(event.getOrderId());
        order.setStatus(OrderStatus.CANCELLED);
        orderRepository.save(order);
    }
    
    @EventHandler
    public void handlePaymentSucceededEvent(PaymentSucceededEvent event) {
        Order order = orderRepository.findById(event.getOrderId());
        order.setStatus(OrderStatus.CONFIRMED);
        orderRepository.save(order);
    }
}

// Payment Service
public class PaymentService {
    private EventBus eventBus;
    private PaymentRepository paymentRepository;
    
    @EventHandler
    public void handleOrderCreatedEvent(OrderCreatedEvent event) {
        try {
            Payment payment = new Payment(event.getOrderId(), event.getAmount());
            boolean success = processPayment(payment);
            
            if (success) {
                paymentRepository.save(payment);
                eventBus.publish(new PaymentSucceededEvent(event.getOrderId()));
            } else {
                eventBus.publish(new PaymentFailedEvent(event.getOrderId(), "Payment processing failed"));
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            eventBus.publish(new PaymentFailedEvent(event.getOrderId(), e.getMessage()));
        }
    }
}
```

### Event-Driven Microservices

Event-Driven Microservices combine the principles of microservices architecture with event-driven communication patterns.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Services communicate primarily through events
- Each service has its own data store
- Services are loosely coupled and independently deployable
- Events serve as the integration mechanism

**Implementation Example**:
```javascript
// Order Service
class OrderService {
    constructor(eventBus, orderRepository) {
        this.eventBus = eventBus;
        this.orderRepository = orderRepository;
        
        // Subscribe to events
        this.eventBus.subscribe('inventory.reserved', this.handleInventoryReserved.bind(this));
        this.eventBus.subscribe('payment.completed', this.handlePaymentCompleted.bind(this));
    }
    
    async createOrder(orderData) {
        const order = {
            id: generateId(),
            customerId: orderData.customerId,
            items: orderData.items,
            status: 'CREATED',
            createdAt: new Date()
        };
        
        await this.orderRepository.save(order);
        
        // Publish event
        await this.eventBus.publish('order.created', {
            orderId: order.id,
            customerId: order.customerId,
            items: order.items
        });
        
        return order;
    }
    
    async handleInventoryReserved(event) {
        const order = await this.orderRepository.findById(event.orderId);
        order.status = 'INVENTORY_RESERVED';
        await this.orderRepository.save(order);
    }
    
    async handlePaymentCompleted(event) {
        const order = await this.orderRepository.findById(event.orderId);
        order.status = 'PAID';
        await this.orderRepository.save(order);
        
        // Publish event
        await this.eventBus.publish('order.ready_for_fulfillment', {
            orderId: order.id,
            shippingAddress: order.shippingAddress
        });
    }
}

// Inventory Service
class InventoryService {
    constructor(eventBus, inventoryRepository) {
        this.eventBus = eventBus;
        this.inventoryRepository = inventoryRepository;
        
        // Subscribe to events
        this.eventBus.subscribe('order.created', this.handleOrderCreated.bind(this));
    }
    
    async handleOrderCreated(event) {
        try {
            // Check and reserve inventory
            for (const item of event.items) {
                await this.reserveInventory(item.productId, item.quantity);
            }
            
            // Publish event
            await this.eventBus.publish('inventory.reserved', {
                orderId: event.orderId,
                success: true
            });
        } catch (error) {
            // Publish failure event
            await this.eventBus.publish('inventory.reservation_failed', {
                orderId: event.orderId,
                reason: error.message
            });
        }
    }
    
    async reserveInventory(productId, quantity) {
        // Implementation details
    }
}
```

## Benefits and Challenges

### Benefits

1. **Loose Coupling**: Components interact through events without direct dependencies, reducing coupling and making the system more maintainable.

2. **Scalability**: Event-driven systems can scale horizontally by adding more event producers or consumers as needed.

3. **Responsiveness**: Systems can react to events in real-time, providing immediate feedback and updates.

4. **Resilience**: Failure in one component doesn't necessarily affect others, and events can be persisted for later processing.

5. **Extensibility**: New functionality can be added by introducing new event consumers without modifying existing components.

6. **Auditability**: Events provide a natural audit trail of all activities and changes within the system.

### Challenges

1. **Eventual Consistency**: Event-driven systems often prioritize availability over immediate consistency, requiring careful handling of temporary inconsistencies.

2. **Complexity**: Understanding the flow of events and their effects can be challenging, especially in large systems.

3. **Debugging**: Tracing issues across asynchronous event flows can be more difficult than in synchronous systems.

4. **Event Schema Evolution**: Managing changes to event schemas while maintaining backward compatibility requires careful planning.

5. **Ordering and Idempotency**: Ensuring correct event ordering and handling duplicate events adds complexity.

6. **Testing**: Testing event-driven systems requires specialized approaches to verify correct behavior across asynchronous boundaries.

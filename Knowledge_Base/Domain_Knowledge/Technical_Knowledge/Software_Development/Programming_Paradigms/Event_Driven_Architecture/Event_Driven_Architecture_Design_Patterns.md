## Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive collection of design patterns commonly used in Event-Driven Architecture (EDA). It serves as a reference guide for architects and developers designing and implementing event-driven systems within the MOAL 2.0 framework, offering solutions to recurring problems and promoting best practices.

## Introduction

Event-Driven Architecture relies on a set of established design patterns to address common challenges related to event production, consumption, processing, and management. These patterns provide reusable solutions that enhance the scalability, resilience, maintainability, and overall effectiveness of event-driven systems.

This reference collection categorizes patterns based on their primary focus:

1. **Event Creation Patterns**: Patterns related to how events are generated and structured.
2. **Event Processing Patterns**: Patterns for handling and reacting to events.
3. **Event Routing Patterns**: Patterns for directing events to the appropriate consumers.
4. **Event Storage Patterns**: Patterns for persisting and managing events.
5. **State Management Patterns**: Patterns for managing application state in event-driven systems.
6. **Integration Patterns**: Patterns for integrating event-driven systems with other architectures.

## 1. Event Creation Patterns

### 1.1 Domain Event Pattern

**Problem**: How to represent significant occurrences within the business domain?

**Solution**: Define events that capture meaningful business state changes. These events should be named in the past tense and contain relevant data about the occurrence.

**Example**: `OrderPlaced`, `PaymentReceived`, `ShipmentDispatched`.

**Benefits**:
- Aligns system behavior with business processes.
- Provides a clear and understandable representation of domain changes.
- Facilitates communication between domain experts and developers.

**Considerations**:
- Requires deep domain understanding.
- Event granularity needs careful consideration.

### 1.2 Event Notification Pattern

**Problem**: How to notify consumers about a state change without sending the full state?

**Solution**: Publish lightweight notification events that indicate a change has occurred. Consumers can then query the source system for the updated state if needed.

**Example**: `UserProfileUpdated` event containing only the user ID. Consumers query the User Service for the full profile.

**Benefits**:
- Reduces event payload size.
- Avoids sending potentially sensitive data in events.
- Simplifies event schema management.

**Considerations**:
- Requires consumers to make additional calls to retrieve state.
- Can lead to increased load on the source system.
- Potential for stale data if the query happens after further changes.

### 1.3 Event-Carried State Transfer Pattern

**Problem**: How to provide consumers with all necessary information to process an event without requiring additional queries?

**Solution**: Include all relevant state data within the event payload. Consumers can process the event autonomously.

**Example**: `OrderPlaced` event containing full order details (customer info, items, total amount).

**Benefits**:
- Reduces coupling between consumers and the source system.
- Improves consumer autonomy and resilience.
- Decreases latency as no additional queries are needed.

**Considerations**:
- Increases event payload size.
- Potential for data duplication across systems.
- Requires careful schema design and evolution management.

### 1.4 Correlation Identifier Pattern

**Problem**: How to track a request or process flow across multiple events and services?

**Solution**: Include a unique correlation identifier in all events related to a specific request or workflow. This allows tracing and monitoring of the entire process.

**Example**: A unique `correlationId` generated when an order is placed and included in all subsequent events (`PaymentProcessed`, `InventoryReserved`, `OrderShipped`).

**Benefits**:
- Enables end-to-end tracing and debugging.
- Facilitates monitoring and analysis of business processes.
- Helps correlate related events for complex event processing.

**Considerations**:
- Requires consistent propagation of the correlation ID across services.

### 1.5 Causation Identifier Pattern

**Problem**: How to understand the causal relationship between events?

**Solution**: Include a causation identifier in events, pointing to the ID of the event that triggered the current event.

**Example**: A `PaymentProcessed` event includes a `causationId` referencing the `eventId` of the `OrderPlaced` event that triggered the payment.

**Benefits**:
- Provides clear lineage of events.
- Helps understand complex event interactions.
- Useful for debugging and auditing.

**Considerations**:
- Adds complexity to event metadata.
- Requires careful management by event producers.

## 2. Event Processing Patterns

### 2.1 Event Listener Pattern

**Problem**: How to react to specific events when they occur?

**Solution**: Implement event listeners (or subscribers) that register interest in specific event types and execute logic when those events are received.

**Example**: A `NotificationService` listens for `OrderShipped` events and sends a shipping confirmation email.

**Benefits**:
- Decouples event producers from consumers.
- Enables modular and extensible system design.
- Allows multiple independent reactions to the same event.

**Considerations**:
- Requires a mechanism for event subscription and dispatching.
- Managing listener lifecycle and error handling is crucial.

### 2.2 Idempotent Consumer Pattern

**Problem**: How to handle duplicate events that might be delivered due to network issues or retries?

**Solution**: Design event consumers to process the same event multiple times without causing unintended side effects. This can be achieved by tracking processed event IDs or designing operations to be inherently idempotent.

**Example**: A payment processing consumer checks if a payment for a specific `orderId` has already been processed before attempting processing again.

**Benefits**:
- Increases system resilience against message delivery issues.
- Simplifies error handling and retry logic.

**Considerations**:
- Requires careful design of processing logic.
- May require maintaining state about processed events.

### 2.3 Event Stream Processing Pattern

**Problem**: How to process continuous streams of events in real-time?

**Solution**: Use stream processing frameworks (e.g., Kafka Streams, Flink, Spark Streaming) to perform operations like filtering, transformation, aggregation, and windowing on event streams.

**Example**: Calculating the average order value over the last hour based on a stream of `OrderPlaced` events.

**Benefits**:
- Enables real-time analytics and decision-making.
- Handles high-volume event streams efficiently.
- Supports complex temporal analysis.

**Considerations**:
- Requires specialized frameworks and expertise.
- Managing state in stream processing can be complex.

### 2.4 Complex Event Processing (CEP) Pattern

**Problem**: How to detect patterns, correlations, and complex situations across multiple events over time?

**Solution**: Use CEP engines to define rules and queries that identify meaningful patterns in event streams.

**Example**: Detecting potential fraud by identifying a pattern of multiple failed login attempts followed by a successful login and a large transaction within a short time window.

**Benefits**:
- Enables sophisticated event analysis and situation detection.
- Supports proactive responses to complex scenarios.

**Considerations**:
- Requires specialized CEP engines and rule definition languages.
- Can be computationally intensive.

## 3. Event Routing Patterns

### 3.1 Publish-Subscribe Channel Pattern

**Problem**: How to deliver an event to multiple interested consumers?

**Solution**: Use a publish-subscribe channel (e.g., Kafka topic, SNS topic) where producers publish events, and multiple consumers can subscribe to receive copies of those events.

**Example**: An `OrderPlaced` event published to an `order-events` topic is consumed by Payment, Inventory, and Notification services.

**Benefits**:
- Decouples producers from consumers.
- Supports one-to-many event distribution.
- Allows dynamic addition/removal of consumers.

**Considerations**:
- Requires middleware that supports publish-subscribe semantics.

### 3.2 Point-to-Point Channel Pattern

**Problem**: How to ensure an event is processed by exactly one consumer?

**Solution**: Use a point-to-point channel (e.g., message queue like SQS or RabbitMQ queue) where producers send events, and only one consumer receives and processes each event.

**Example**: Sending commands like `ProcessPayment` to a queue ensures only one payment processor handles it.

**Benefits**:
- Guarantees single processing of events.
- Useful for distributing tasks among competing consumers.

**Considerations**:
- Requires middleware that supports queuing semantics.
- Does not support broadcasting events to multiple consumers.

### 3.3 Content-Based Router Pattern

**Problem**: How to route events to different consumers based on their content?

**Solution**: Implement a router component that inspects the content of each event and forwards it to the appropriate channel or consumer based on predefined rules.

**Example**: Routing `OrderPlaced` events to different fulfillment centers based on the shipping region specified in the event payload.

**Benefits**:
- Enables dynamic routing logic.
- Decouples producers from specific consumer destinations.

**Considerations**:
- The router can become a bottleneck or single point of failure.
- Routing logic can become complex.

### 3.4 Message Filter Pattern

**Problem**: How to allow consumers to receive only the events they are interested in?

**Solution**: Implement filtering mechanisms, either on the consumer side or within the messaging infrastructure, that allow consumers to specify criteria for the events they want to receive.

**Example**: A `ReportingService` subscribes to `order-events` but filters to receive only events with `totalAmount > 1000`.

**Benefits**:
- Reduces unnecessary processing by consumers.
- Optimizes network bandwidth usage.

**Considerations**:
- Requires filtering capabilities in the messaging system or consumers.
- Filter logic needs careful management.

### 3.5 Dead Letter Channel Pattern

**Problem**: What to do with events that cannot be processed successfully after multiple retries?

**Solution**: Route unprocessable events to a dedicated Dead Letter Channel (or Queue/Topic) for later inspection, analysis, and potential manual intervention or reprocessing.

**Example**: An event consumer attempts to process an event 5 times with backoff; if it still fails, the event is moved to the `order-events-dlq` topic.

**Benefits**:
- Prevents poison messages from blocking processing.
- Provides a mechanism for handling persistent errors.
- Enables analysis of failed events.

**Considerations**:
- Requires monitoring and management of the Dead Letter Channel.
- Need procedures for handling events in the DLC.

## 4. Event Storage Patterns

### 4.1 Event Sourcing Pattern

**Problem**: How to capture the complete history of state changes in an application?

**Solution**: Store all changes to application state as an immutable sequence of events. The current state is derived by replaying these events.

**Example**: Storing `ItemAddedToCart`, `ItemRemovedFromCart`, `QuantityUpdated` events for a shopping cart instead of just the final cart state.

**Benefits**:
- Provides a complete audit log.
- Enables reconstruction of past states.
- Supports temporal queries.
- Simplifies handling of concurrent updates (optimistic concurrency).

**Considerations**:
- Querying current state requires replaying events or maintaining projections.
- Schema evolution requires careful handling.
- Can be more complex to implement than traditional state persistence.

### 4.2 Event Streaming Pattern

**Problem**: How to handle and store high-volume, continuous streams of events?

**Solution**: Use event streaming platforms (e.g., Kafka, Pulsar) that provide durable, ordered, and partitioned logs for storing and processing event streams.

**Example**: Using Kafka to store clickstream data from a website for real-time analytics.

**Benefits**:
- Handles high throughput and low latency.
- Provides durable event storage.
- Supports multiple consumers reading the stream independently.
- Enables event replay.

**Considerations**:
- Requires specialized infrastructure.
- Managing partitions and consumer offsets adds complexity.

### 4.3 Snapshotting Pattern (for Event Sourcing)

**Problem**: How to optimize the reconstruction of aggregate state when the event stream becomes very long in Event Sourcing?

**Solution**: Periodically save a snapshot of the aggregate's current state. To reconstruct the state, load the latest snapshot and replay only the events that occurred after the snapshot was taken.

**Example**: Saving a snapshot of a `ShoppingCart` aggregate every 100 events.

**Benefits**:
- Reduces the time required to load aggregates with long histories.
- Improves query performance for current state.

**Considerations**:
- Adds complexity to the persistence mechanism.
- Snapshots might become stale if not updated frequently.
- Requires a strategy for snapshot frequency and management.

## 5. State Management Patterns

### 5.1 Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) Pattern

**Problem**: How to optimize read and write operations independently in a system, especially when using Event Sourcing?

**Solution**: Separate the model used for updating state (command model) from the model used for querying state (query model). Events published by the command model are used to update the query model, which is optimized for reads.

**Example**: An `OrderService` handles commands like `PlaceOrder` (updating the event store), while a separate `OrderQueryService` maintains a denormalized read model (e.g., in a document database) updated by listening to `OrderPlaced` events.

**Benefits**:
- Allows independent optimization and scaling of read and write paths.
- Simplifies complex query requirements.
- Works well with Event Sourcing.

**Considerations**:
- Introduces eventual consistency between command and query models.
- Increases system complexity.
- Requires mechanisms to keep read models synchronized.

### 5.2 State Reconciliation Pattern

**Problem**: How to ensure consistency between different views or projections of state derived from events?

**Solution**: Implement mechanisms to detect and reconcile inconsistencies between different state representations. This might involve periodic checks, checksums, or dedicated reconciliation processes.

**Example**: A background process periodically compares the state derived from an event stream with a materialized view and corrects discrepancies.

**Benefits**:
- Helps maintain data integrity in eventually consistent systems.
- Provides a safety net against synchronization errors.

**Considerations**:
- Adds complexity and overhead.
- Reconciliation logic can be difficult to implement correctly.

### 5.3 Process Manager / Saga Pattern

**Problem**: How to manage long-running business processes or distributed transactions that span multiple services and involve multiple events?

**Solution**: Implement a Process Manager (Orchestration) or use Saga choreography (event-based coordination) to track the state of the process and coordinate actions across services. Sagas typically involve compensating actions to handle failures.

**Example**: An `OrderPlacementSaga` coordinates `OrderService`, `PaymentService`, and `InventoryService`. If payment fails, it triggers compensating actions like cancelling the order and releasing inventory.

**Benefits**:
- Manages complex, distributed workflows.
- Maintains consistency across services without distributed locking.
- Improves resilience by handling partial failures.

**Considerations**:
- Increases complexity of process logic.
- Debugging sagas can be challenging.
- Requires careful design of compensating actions.

## 6. Integration Patterns

### 6.1 Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL) Pattern

**Problem**: How to integrate an event-driven system with a legacy system or external system that uses a different model or communication style?

**Solution**: Implement an Anti-Corruption Layer that translates events and commands between the event-driven system and the external system, protecting the domain model of the event-driven system from being polluted by external concepts.

**Example**: An ACL translates `OrderPlaced` events into API calls expected by a legacy fulfillment system.

**Benefits**:
- Isolates the core domain model from external influences.
- Facilitates integration with disparate systems.
- Provides a clear boundary for translation logic.

**Considerations**:
- Adds an extra layer of indirection and potential latency.
- Requires maintenance as external systems evolve.

### 6.2 Event Gateway Pattern

**Problem**: How to expose event streams to external consumers or ingest events from external producers securely and reliably?

**Solution**: Implement an Event Gateway that acts as a controlled entry/exit point for events. It can handle authentication, authorization, protocol translation, schema validation, and rate limiting.

**Example**: An API Gateway extended to handle WebSocket subscriptions for real-time event streams or an ingestion service that validates and publishes events from external partners to internal Kafka topics.

**Benefits**:
- Centralizes control over external event interactions.
- Enhances security and reliability.
- Decouples internal event infrastructure from external consumers/producers.

**Considerations**:
- The gateway can become a bottleneck.
- Requires careful design to handle scalability and availability.

### 6.3 Change Data Capture (CDC) Pattern

**Problem**: How to generate events based on changes occurring in a traditional database that doesn't natively produce events?

**Solution**: Use Change Data Capture tools (e.g., Debezium) to monitor database transaction logs (like WAL for PostgreSQL or binlog for MySQL) and publish events corresponding to data changes (inserts, updates, deletes).

**Example**: Using Debezium to capture changes in a legacy `products` table and publish `ProductCreated`, `ProductUpdated`, `ProductDeleted` events to Kafka.

**Benefits**:
- Enables integration of legacy systems into an event-driven architecture without modifying the source system.
- Provides low-latency capture of data changes.

**Considerations**:
- Requires access to database transaction logs.
- Adds operational complexity for managing CDC tools.
- Mapping database changes to meaningful domain events might require additional transformation logic.

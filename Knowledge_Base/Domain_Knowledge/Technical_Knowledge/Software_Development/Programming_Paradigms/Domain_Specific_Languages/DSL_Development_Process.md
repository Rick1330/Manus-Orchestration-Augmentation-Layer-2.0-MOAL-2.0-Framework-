## Case Example: Financial Reporting DSL

To illustrate the DSL development process, consider the development of a DSL for financial reporting:

### Phase 1: Domain Analysis

**Stakeholders:**
- Financial analysts who create reports
- Compliance officers who verify regulatory requirements
- IT staff who maintain systems
- Executives who consume reports

**Domain Concepts:**
- Financial accounts and hierarchies
- Time periods and comparisons
- Calculations and formulas
- Presentation formats
- Regulatory requirements

**Use Cases:**
- Creating quarterly financial statements
- Generating regulatory compliance reports
- Performing financial analysis
- Creating executive dashboards

**DSL Goals:**
- Reduce report creation time by 50%
- Eliminate manual calculation errors
- Enable analysts to create reports without IT assistance
- Ensure regulatory compliance
- Support audit trails

### Phase 2: Language Design

**Abstract Syntax:**
- Report definitions
- Account references
- Time period specifications
- Calculation expressions
- Formatting rules

**Concrete Syntax (Textual):**
```
report "Q1 2025 Financial Summary" {
  period 2025-Q1
  compare-to 2024-Q1
  
  section "Revenue" {
    show account "Total Revenue" {
      format currency
      variance-highlight threshold 5%
    }
    
    breakdown by "Revenue Category" {
      show-top 5
      others-as "Other Revenue"
    }
  }
  
  section "Expenses" {
    show accounts matching "Operating Expense:*" {
      format currency
      sort descending
    }
    
    calculate "Expense Ratio" as {
      sum("Operating Expense:*") / "Total Revenue"
      format percentage(2)
    }
  }
  
  summary {
    show "Net Income"
    show "Profit Margin" as "Net Income" / "Total Revenue" {
      format percentage(2)
    }
  }
}
```

**Semantics:**
- Account references resolve to the financial data model

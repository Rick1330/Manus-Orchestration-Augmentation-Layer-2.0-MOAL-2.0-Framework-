  - Domain_Knowledge/
    - Technical_Knowledge/
      - Software_Development/
        - Programming_Paradigms/
          - Domain_Specific_Languages/
- Each knowledge file has internal structure with clear sections and subsections
- Content is organized in a logical progression from fundamental concepts to advanced applications

**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT

### 2. Niche Specificity

**Requirement**: Content must focus on specific niches rather than general examples.

**Assessment**:
- The Domain Specific Languages niche is highly specific within the Programming Paradigms subcategory
- Content focuses specifically on DSL concepts, implementation approaches, patterns, and applications
- Examples are concrete and specific to DSL development and usage
- Each knowledge file addresses distinct aspects of the DSL domain

**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT

### 3. Intensive Population

**Requirement**: Each niche subcategory must contain at least 5-7 distinct, well-developed knowledge files.

**Assessment**:
The Domain Specific Languages niche contains 5 comprehensive knowledge files:
1. **Domain-Specific Languages: Fundamentals and Design Principles** - Concept definition covering core principles and theoretical foundations
2. **Implementing Domain-Specific Languages** - Process documentation for implementation approaches and tools
3. **DSL Design Patterns and Best Practices** - Reference collection of patterns and practices
4. **Case Studies: Domain-Specific Languages in Industry** - Collection of real-world applications and lessons
5. **DSL Development Process: From Concept to Implementation** - Comprehensive process guide

Each file is substantial, detailed, and covers a distinct aspect of the domain.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT

### 4. High Quality Content

**Requirement**: Each file should be detailed, accurate, well-structured, and practical.

**Assessment**:
- All files use proper Markdown formatting with consistent heading structure
- Content is comprehensive, with each file containing several thousand words of detailed information
- Information is technically accurate and reflects current best practices
- Examples are concrete and illustrative
- Content is written in clear, professional language
- Each file includes both theoretical foundations and practical applications

**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT

### 5. Interlinking

**Requirement**: Knowledge files should link to related concepts and relevant Expertise Facets.

**Assessment**:
- Each file contains explicit references to related concepts within the Knowledge Base
- Files include connections to relevant Expertise Facets in the MOAL 2.0 framework
- The "Integration with MOAL 2.0" section in each file establishes clear connections to the framework
- Cross-references between files create a cohesive knowledge network

**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT

### 6. Template Utilization

**Requirement**: Files should use and refine the Knowledge Templates to ensure consistency.

**Assessment**:
- Files follow consistent templates appropriate to their content type:
  - Concept Definition format for fundamental concepts
  - Process Documentation format for implementation and development processes
  - Reference Collection format for patterns and case studies
- Each file includes standard sections:
  - Basic Information
  - Purpose
  - Main Content Sections
  - Integration with MOAL 2.0
- Templates have been appropriately adapted for the specific content of each file

**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT

### 7. Practicality

**Requirement**: Content should be directly usable by the MOAL 2.0 system and human collaborators.

**Assessment**:
- Content provides actionable guidance for DSL development and implementation
- Files include practical examples, code snippets, and implementation approaches
- Decision frameworks and evaluation criteria support practical decision-making
- Case studies offer concrete lessons applicable to new projects
- Content is structured to support both human understanding and potential machine processing

**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT

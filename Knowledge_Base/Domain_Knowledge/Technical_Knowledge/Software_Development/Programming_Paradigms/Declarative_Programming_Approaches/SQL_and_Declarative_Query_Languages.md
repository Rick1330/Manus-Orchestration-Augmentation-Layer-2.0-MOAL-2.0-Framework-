# SQL and Declarative Query Languages

## Basic Information
- **Concept Name**: SQL and Declarative Query Languages
- **Domain**: Technical Knowledge
- **Category**: Software Development/Programming Paradigms
- **Last Updated**: 2025-05-24

## Definition
Declarative query languages are programming languages designed for retrieving and manipulating data from databases or other data sources by expressing what data is required rather than how to retrieve it. SQL (Structured Query Language) is the most prominent example, serving as the standard language for relational database management systems. These languages embody the declarative programming paradigm by allowing users to specify the desired result set without detailing the step-by-step procedures for obtaining it.

## Key Characteristics
- **Declarative Nature**: Specifies what data to retrieve, not how to retrieve it
- **Set-Based Operations**: Works with sets of data rather than individual records
- **Relational Algebra Foundation**: Based on mathematical principles of relational algebra
- **Data Independence**: Separates logical data representation from physical storage details
- **Non-Procedural Syntax**: Lacks traditional control flow structures like loops and conditionals
- **Optimization by Engine**: Query optimization is handled automatically by the database engine
- **Standardization**: SQL in particular has ANSI/ISO standards for consistency across implementations
- **Composability**: Queries can be nested and combined to form more complex operations
- **Expressive Power**: Can express complex data transformations concisely
- **Declarative Constraints**: Allows specification of data integrity rules declaratively

## Core Principles

### Relational Model and Algebra
Declarative query languages, particularly SQL, are built on the foundation of the relational model proposed by E.F. Codd in 1970. This model represents data as relations (tables) with rows (tuples) and columns (attributes), and operations on these relations are defined by relational algebra.

The core operations in relational algebra include:
- **Selection (σ)**: Filtering rows based on a condition
- **Projection (π)**: Selecting specific columns
- **Union (∪)**: Combining rows from two compatible relations
- **Intersection (∩)**: Finding common rows between relations
- **Difference (-)**: Removing rows that appear in another relation
- **Cartesian Product (×)**: Combining every row from one relation with every row from another
- **Join (⋈)**: Combining related rows from different relations

SQL implements these operations through its syntax:

```sql
-- Selection (WHERE clause)
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Engineering';

-- Projection (column list in SELECT)
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees;

-- Union
SELECT * FROM current_employees
UNION
SELECT * FROM former_employees;

-- Intersection
SELECT * FROM skilled_employees
INTERSECT
SELECT * FROM available_employees;

-- Difference
SELECT * FROM all_applicants
EXCEPT
SELECT * FROM hired_applicants;

-- Cartesian Product
SELECT * FROM employees, departments;

-- Join
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

### Declarative Data Manipulation
Declarative query languages separate the what from the how, allowing users to express their data requirements without specifying the retrieval algorithm. This principle applies to all data operations:

1. **Queries (Reading)**: Specify the desired result set characteristics
2. **Insertions**: Specify the data to be added
3. **Updates**: Specify which data to modify and how
4. **Deletions**: Specify which data to remove

For example, in SQL:

```sql
-- Query: Find all customers who spent more than $1000 last month
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, SUM(o.amount) as total_spent
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 1 MONTH)
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name
HAVING total_spent > 1000
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;

-- Insertion: Add a new employee
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, department_id, hire_date)
VALUES ('John', 'Smith', 3, CURRENT_DATE);

-- Update: Give a 10% raise to all employees in the Engineering department
UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary * 1.1
WHERE department_id = (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE name = 'Engineering');

-- Deletion: Remove all orders older than a year
DELETE FROM orders
WHERE order_date < DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 1 YEAR);
```

In each case, the language expresses the intent (what) without specifying the implementation details (how).

### Query Optimization
A fundamental principle of declarative query languages is that the system, not the programmer, determines the most efficient way to execute a query. This separation allows the database engine to:

1. Analyze the query structure
2. Consider available indexes and statistics
3. Evaluate multiple possible execution plans
4. Select the optimal execution strategy

This optimization process is transparent to the user, who only needs to express the query correctly. The same query might be executed differently depending on:
- Database size and statistics
- Available indexes
- System resources
- Database engine implementation

For example, the following query could be executed in multiple ways:

```sql
SELECT c.name, COUNT(o.order_id) as order_count
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE c.region = 'Northeast'
GROUP BY c.name
HAVING COUNT(o.order_id) > 5;
```

The database engine might:
- Use an index on `region` to filter customers first
- Use an index on the join columns for efficient joining
- Choose between hash joins, nested loop joins, or merge joins
- Decide whether to sort data for grouping or use hash-based grouping
- Potentially parallelize operations across multiple processors

### Declarative Constraints
Declarative query languages allow for the specification of data integrity rules as constraints rather than procedural checks. These constraints are enforced automatically by the database system.

Common types of constraints include:

```sql
-- Primary Key constraint
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Foreign Key constraint
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);

-- Unique constraint
CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_code VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE,
    department_name VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Check constraint
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(10,2) CHECK (price > 0),
    stock_quantity INT CHECK (stock_quantity >= 0)
);

-- Not Null constraint
CREATE TABLE contacts (
    contact_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(20)
);
```

These constraints declaratively express rules about the data without specifying how to enforce them.

## Historical Context

The concept of declarative query languages emerged from database research in the 1970s, with SQL becoming the most influential implementation.

In 1970, E.F. Codd published his seminal paper "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks," which introduced the relational model and laid the theoretical foundation for declarative query languages. Codd's work was revolutionary because it proposed representing data in simple tables (relations) and manipulating them using operations from relational algebra.

The first implementation of SQL (initially called SEQUEL - Structured English Query Language) was developed by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce at IBM in the early 1970s as part of the System R project. The language was designed to make Codd's relational model accessible to non-technical users through a syntax resembling natural English.

In 1979, Oracle (then Relational Software, Inc.) released the first commercially available implementation of SQL. Throughout the 1980s, SQL became increasingly popular as relational database systems gained traction in business applications.

The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) published the first SQL standard in 1986, followed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. Subsequent revisions (SQL-89, SQL-92, SQL:1999, SQL:2003, SQL:2008, SQL:2011, SQL:2016, and SQL:2023) have added features like transactions, object-relational capabilities, XML support, window functions, and JSON support.

In parallel with SQL's evolution, other declarative query languages emerged for different data models:
- QUEL, a competitor to SQL in the 1970s and 1980s
- OQL (Object Query Language) for object databases in the 1990s
- XQuery for XML data in the early 2000s
- SPARQL for RDF data and semantic web applications
- GraphQL for API queries, introduced by Facebook in 2015
- Datalog for deductive databases

The declarative approach to data querying has proven remarkably durable, with SQL remaining the dominant database language for over four decades while continuing to evolve with new capabilities.

## Related Concepts
- **Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)**: Systems that implement the relational model and typically use SQL as their query language.
- **NoSQL Databases**: Non-relational databases that often provide their own declarative query languages tailored to specific data models.
- **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**: Tools that translate between object-oriented code and relational databases, often generating SQL declaratively.
- **Query Builders**: Libraries that allow programmatic construction of SQL queries in a declarative style.
- **Declarative Programming**: The broader programming paradigm that includes declarative query languages.
- **Functional Programming**: Another declarative paradigm that shares some philosophical similarities with declarative query languages.
- **Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs)**: Specialized languages for particular domains, of which SQL is a prominent example.

## Practical Applications

### Data Retrieval and Reporting

SQL excels at retrieving and aggregating data for reports:

```sql
-- Sales report by region and quarter
SELECT 
    r.region_name,
    CONCAT('Q', QUARTER(o.order_date)) as quarter,
    YEAR(o.order_date) as year,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) as order_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.customer_id) as customer_count,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) as total_sales,
    AVG(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) as average_order_value
FROM 
    orders o
JOIN 
    order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN 
    customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN 
    regions r ON c.region_id = r.region_id
WHERE 
    o.order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
GROUP BY 
    r.region_name, 
    QUARTER(o.order_date),
    YEAR(o.order_date)
ORDER BY 
    r.region_name,
    year,
    quarter;
```

This query declaratively specifies a complex sales report without detailing how to join the tables, calculate the aggregations, or sort the results.

### Data Analysis and Business Intelligence

SQL supports sophisticated analytical queries with window functions, common table expressions, and other advanced features:

```sql
-- Customer purchase analysis with ranking and moving averages
WITH customer_purchases AS (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_id,
        c.name,
        o.order_date,
        SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) as order_total
    FROM 
        customers c
    JOIN 
        orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    JOIN 
        order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
    GROUP BY 
        c.customer_id, c.name, o.order_date
)
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    name,
    order_date,
    order_total,
    SUM(order_total) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) as cumulative_total,
    AVG(order_total) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as moving_avg_3_orders,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_total DESC) as order_rank_by_value
FROM 
    customer_purchases
ORDER BY 
    customer_id, 
    order_date;
```

This analysis includes cumulative totals, moving averages, and ranking, all expressed declaratively.

### Data Integration and ETL

SQL is widely used for Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes:

```sql
-- ETL process to populate a sales fact table
INSERT INTO sales_facts (
    date_key,
    product_key,
    store_key,
    customer_key,
    promotion_key,
    quantity_sold,
    unit_price,
    extended_price,
    discount_amount,
    net_price
)
SELECT 
    d.date_key,
    p.product_key,
    s.store_key,
    c.customer_key,
    COALESCE(pr.promotion_key, 0) as promotion_key,
    oi.quantity as quantity_sold,
    oi.unit_price,
    oi.quantity * oi.unit_price as extended_price,
    COALESCE(oi.discount, 0) as discount_amount,
    (oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) - COALESCE(oi.discount, 0) as net_price
FROM 
    source_orders o
JOIN 
    source_order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN 
    dim_date d ON o.order_date = d.full_date
JOIN 
    dim_product p ON oi.product_id = p.source_product_id
JOIN 
    dim_store s ON o.store_id = s.source_store_id
JOIN 
    dim_customer c ON o.customer_id = c.source_customer_id
LEFT JOIN 
    source_promotions sp ON oi.promotion_id = sp.promotion_id
LEFT JOIN 
    dim_promotion pr ON sp.promotion_id = pr.source_promotion_id
WHERE 
    o.order_date >= '2024-01-01'
    AND o.order_status = 'Completed';
```

This ETL operation transforms source data into a dimensional model for analytics, with all the complex transformations expressed declaratively.

### API Queries with GraphQL

GraphQL provides a declarative approach to API queries:

```graphql
# Query to fetch user data with posts and comments
query {
  user(id: "123") {
    id
    name
    email
    posts(last: 5) {
      id
      title
      content
      publishedAt
      comments {
        id
        author {
          name
        }
        content
        createdAt
      }
      categories {
        name
      }
    }
    followers(first: 10) {
      name
      avatarUrl
    }
  }
}
```

This query declaratively specifies exactly what data is needed from the API, allowing the server to optimize the retrieval.

### Semantic Web Queries with SPARQL

SPARQL enables querying RDF data in the semantic web:

```sparql
# Find all scientists born in Germany with their discoveries
PREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>
PREFIX dbp: <http://dbpedia.org/property/>
PREFIX dbr: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/>

SELECT ?scientist ?name ?discovery ?year
WHERE {
  ?scientist a dbo:Scientist ;
             dbo:birthPlace ?birthPlace ;
             foaf:name ?name ;
             dbp:knownFor ?discovery .
  ?birthPlace dbo:country dbr:Germany .
  OPTIONAL { ?discovery dbp:year ?year }
}
ORDER BY ?name
```

This query searches a knowledge graph for scientists born in Germany and their discoveries, demonstrating the declarative approach to semantic data.

## Major Declarative Query Languages

### SQL (Structured Query Language)

SQL is the standard language for relational databases, with key components including:

1. **Data Definition Language (DDL)** for defining database structures:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE employees (
       employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       first_name VARCHAR(50),
       last_name VARCHAR(50),
       department_id INT,
       hire_date DATE,
       salary DECIMAL(10,2),
       FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)
   );
   
   ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(100);
   
   DROP TABLE temporary_data;
   ```

2. **Data Manipulation Language (DML)** for manipulating data:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO employees VALUES (101, 'John', 'Smith', 3, '2023-06-15', 75000);
   
   UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.05 WHERE department_id = 3;
   
   DELETE FROM employees WHERE hire_date < '2020-01-01';
   ```

3. **Data Query Language (DQL)** for querying data:
   ```sql
   SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
   FROM employees e
   JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
   WHERE e.salary > 70000
   ORDER BY e.last_name, e.first_name;
   ```

4. **Data Control Language (DCL)** for controlling access:
   ```sql
   GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON employees TO hr_staff;
   
   REVOKE DELETE ON employees FROM temp_users;
   ```

5. **Transaction Control Language (TCL)** for managing transactions:
   ```sql
   BEGIN TRANSACTION;
   
   UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 1000 WHERE account_id = 123;
   UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 1000 WHERE account_id = 456;
   
   COMMIT;
   ```

SQL has evolved significantly over time, with modern SQL including advanced features like:

- **Window Functions** for analytics:
  ```sql
  SELECT 
      department_id,
      employee_id,
      salary,
      AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) as dept_avg_salary,
      salary - AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) as diff_from_avg,
      RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) as salary_rank
  FROM employees;
  ```

- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** for query readability:
  ```sql
  WITH regional_sales AS (
      SELECT region, SUM(amount) as total_sales
      FROM orders
      GROUP BY region
  ),
  top_regions AS (
      SELECT region
      FROM regional_sales
      ORDER BY total_sales DESC
      LIMIT 3
  )
  SELECT region, product, SUM(quantity) as product_units
  FROM orders
  WHERE region IN (SELECT region FROM top_regions)
  GROUP BY region, product
  ORDER BY region, product_units DESC;
  ```

- **JSON Support** for semi-structured data:
  ```sql
  SELECT 
      id,
      JSON_EXTRACT(data, '$.name') as name,
      JSON_EXTRACT(data, '$.address.city') as city
  FROM customers
  WHERE JSON_EXTRACT(data, '$.preferences.notifications') = 'email';
  ```

### GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need:

```graphql
# Define schema (server-side)
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
  posts: [Post!]!
  followers: [User!]!
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  content: String!
  author: User!
  comments: [Comment!]!
  categories: [Category!]!
}

# Query (client-side)
query {
  user(id: "123") {
    name
    posts(limit: 5) {
      title
      comments {
        author {
          name
        }
        content
      }
    }
  }
}

# Mutation (client-side)
mutation {
  createPost(
    title: "GraphQL Fundamentals"
    content: "GraphQL is a declarative query language..."
    authorId: "123"
  ) {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

GraphQL's declarative nature allows clients to specify exactly what data they need, avoiding over-fetching or under-fetching of data.

### SPARQL

SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is used to query RDF data in the semantic web:

```sparql
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
PREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>

SELECT ?person ?name ?birth ?death ?description
WHERE {
  ?person a dbo:Philosopher ;
          foaf:name ?name ;
          dbo:birthDate ?birth .
  OPTIONAL { ?person dbo:deathDate ?death }
  OPTIONAL { ?person dbo:abstract ?description . FILTER(LANG(?description) = "en") }
  FILTER(?birth < "1800-01-01"^^xsd:date)
}
ORDER BY ?birth
LIMIT 100
```

SPARQL enables complex queries across linked data, supporting the vision of the semantic web.

### XQuery

XQuery is a declarative language for querying XML data:

```xquery
(: Find all books published after 2000 with their authors :)
for $book in doc("books.xml")//book
where $book/year > 2000
return
  <result>
    <title>{$book/title/text()}</title>
    <authors>
      {
        for $author in $book/author
        return <author>{$author/text()}</author>
      }
    </authors>
    <year>{$book/year/text()}</year>
  </result>
```

XQuery combines aspects of query languages with functional programming to process XML data.

### Datalog

Datalog is a declarative logic programming language often used for deductive databases:

```datalog
% Facts
parent(john, mary).
parent(mary, ann).
parent(mary, tom).
parent(bob, john).

% Rules
ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y).
ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), ancestor(Z, Y).

% Query
?- ancestor(bob, tom).
```

Datalog's logical foundation makes it well-suited for expressing recursive queries and complex relationships.

## Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages

1. **Abstraction from Implementation**: Users focus on what data they need, not how to retrieve it, reducing complexity.

2. **Query Optimization**: Database engines can optimize query execution based on statistics, indexes, and other factors.

3. **Conciseness**: Complex data operations can be expressed in relatively few lines of code.

4. **Readability**: Declarative queries often resemble natural language, making them more accessible to non-programmers.

5. **Data Independence**: Changes to the physical data storage don't require changes to queries as long as the logical model remains the same.

6. **Set-Based Processing**: Operating on sets of data is often more efficient than record-by-record processing.

7. **Standardization**: Languages like SQL have established standards, promoting portability across systems.

8. **Separation of Concerns**: Application logic is separated from data access logic.

### Limitations

1. **Performance Control**: Limited control over exactly how queries are executed can sometimes lead to suboptimal performance.

2. **Procedural Operations**: Some operations are awkward to express declaratively and might be more natural in procedural code.

3. **Learning Curve**: The declarative paradigm requires a different way of thinking that can be challenging for developers accustomed to procedural programming.

4. **Debugging Complexity**: It can be difficult to debug complex queries, especially when optimization transforms the execution plan.

5. **Vendor Extensions**: Despite standardization, many implementations add proprietary extensions that reduce portability.

6. **Limited Expressiveness**: Some complex algorithms or operations may be difficult or impossible to express purely declaratively.

7. **Impedance Mismatch**: Integrating declarative query languages with procedural programming languages can create friction.

## Common Misconceptions

One common misconception is that declarative query languages like SQL are not "real programming languages." In fact, SQL is Turing-complete (with recursive common table expressions) and can express complex computational logic.

Another misconception is that declarative queries are always slower than hand-coded procedural algorithms. Modern query optimizers are sophisticated and often generate execution plans that outperform manually written code, especially for complex operations on large datasets.

Some developers believe that learning SQL is less important with the rise of ORM tools. However, understanding SQL remains crucial for optimizing database interactions, troubleshooting performance issues, and handling complex queries that ORMs struggle with.

There's also a misconception that NoSQL databases don't use declarative query languages. Many NoSQL systems have developed their own declarative query languages tailored to their data models, such as MongoDB's query language or Cassandra's CQL.

## Integration with MOAL 2.0

Within the MOAL 2.0 framework, SQL and Declarative Query Languages support several Expertise Facets. The Data Management Facet benefits from declarative approaches to data retrieval and manipulation, enabling efficient access to structured information. The Software Development Facet is enhanced by the ability to interact with databases using high-level, declarative syntax rather than low-level data access code.

The Knowledge Representation Facet is supported by declarative query languages' ability to model and query complex relationships between entities, particularly in languages like SPARQL for semantic knowledge representation. The Analytical Thinking Facet benefits from the powerful analytical capabilities of modern SQL, including window functions and complex aggregations.

By incorporating SQL and Declarative Query Languages into the Knowledge Base, the MOAL 2.0 framework provides practitioners with essential tools for data access, integration, and analysis across various domains, supporting both technical implementation and higher-level knowledge management functions.
